                DynamicTreeNode illustrates one of the possible ways in which dynamic
                  loading can be used in tree.  The basic premise behind this is that
                  getChildCount() will be messaged from JTreeModel before any children
                  are asked for.  So, the first time getChildCount() is issued the
                  children are loaded.&lt;p&gt;
                  It should be noted that isLeaf will also be messaged from the model.
                  The default behavior of TreeNode is to message getChildCount to
                  determine this. As such, isLeaf is subclassed to always return false.&lt;p&gt;
                  There are others ways this could be accomplished as well.  Instead of
                  subclassing TreeNode you could subclass JTreeModel and do the same
                  thing in getChildCount().  Or, if you aren&apos;t using TreeNode you could
                  write your own TreeModel implementation.
                  Another solution would be to listen for TreeNodeExpansion events and
                  the first time a node has been expanded post the appropriate insertion
                  events.  I would not recommend this approach though, the other two
                  are much simpler and cleaner (and are faster from the perspective of
                  how tree deals with it).
                  NOTE: getAllowsChildren() can be messaged before getChildCount().
                  For this example the nodes always allow children, so it isn&apos;t
                  a problem, but if you do support true leaf nodes you may want
                  to check for loading in getAllowsChildren too.
