                Authenticator represents an implementation of an HTTP authentication
                  mechanism. Sub-classes provide implementations of specific mechanisms
                  such as Digest or Basic auth. Instances are invoked to provide verification
                  of the authentication information provided in all incoming requests.
                  Note. This implies that any caching of credentials or other authentication
                  information must be done outside of this class.

                called to authenticate each incoming request. The implementation
                  must return a Failure, Success or Retry object as appropriate :-
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Failure means the authentication has completed, but has failed
                  due to invalid credentials.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Sucess means that the authentication
                  has succeeded, and a Principal object representing the user
                  can be retrieved by calling Sucess.getPrincipal() .
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Retry means that another HTTP exchange is required. Any response
                  headers needing to be sent back to the client are set in the
                  given HttpExchange. The response code to be returned must be provided
                  in the Retry object. Retry may occur multiple times.
