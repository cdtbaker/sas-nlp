                  It takes the responsiblity of checking the peer identity with its
                  principal declared in the cerificate.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The class provides an alternative to &lt;code&gt;HostnameVerifer&lt;/code&gt;.
                  If application customizes its &lt;code&gt;HostnameVerifer&lt;/code&gt; for
                  &lt;code&gt;HttpsURLConnection&lt;/code&gt;, the peer identity will be checked
                  by the customized &lt;code&gt;HostnameVerifer&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, it will
                  be checked by the extended trust manager.

                  RFC2830 defines the server identification specification for &quot;LDAP&quot;

                  client identification specification for &quot;HTTPS&quot; algorithm.
