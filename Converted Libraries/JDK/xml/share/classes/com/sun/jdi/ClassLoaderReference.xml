                A class loader object from the target VM.
                  A ClassLoaderReference is an {@link ObjectReference} with additional
                  access to classloader-specific information from the target VM. Instances
                  ClassLoaderReference are obtained through calls to{@link ReferenceType#classLoader}

                Returns a list of all classes for which this class loader has
                  been recorded as the initiating loader in the target VM.
                  The list contains ReferenceTypes defined directly by this loader
                  (as returned by {@link #definedClasses}) and any types for which
                  loading was delegated by this class loader to another class loader.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The visible class list has useful properties with respect to
                  the type namespace. A particular type name will occur at most
                  once in the list. Each field or variable declared with that
                  type name in a class defined by
                  this class loader must be resolved to that single type.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  No ordering of the returned list is guaranteed.

                  for more information on the initiating classloader.

                  Note that unlike {@link #definedClasses()}and {@link VirtualMachine#allClasses()},
                  some of the returned reference types may not be prepared.
                  Attempts to perform some operations on unprepared reference types
                  (e.g. {@link ReferenceType#fields() fields()}) will throw
                  a {@link ClassNotPreparedException}.
                  Use {@link ReferenceType#isPrepared()} to determine if
                  a reference type is prepared.
