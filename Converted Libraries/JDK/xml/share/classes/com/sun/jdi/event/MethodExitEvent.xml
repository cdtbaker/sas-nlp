                Notification of a method return in the target VM. This event
                  is generated after all code in the method has executed, but the
                  location of this event is the last executed location in the method.
                  Method exit events are generated for both native and non-native
                  methods. Method exit events are not generated if the method terminates
                  with a thrown exception.
