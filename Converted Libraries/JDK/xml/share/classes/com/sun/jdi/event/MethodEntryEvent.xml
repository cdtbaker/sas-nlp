                Notification of a method invocation in the target VM. This event
                  occurs after entry into the invoked method and before any
                  code has executed.
                  Method entry events are generated for both native and non-native
                  methods.
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  In some VMs method entry events can occur for a particular thread
                  before its {@link ThreadStartEvent} occurs if methods are called
                  as part of the thread&apos;s initialization.
