                Notification of a breakpoint in the target VM.
                  The breakpoint event
                  is generated before the code at its location is executed.
                  When a location
                  is reached which satisfies a currently enabled{@link com.sun.jdi.request.BreakpointRequest breakpoint request},
                  an {@link EventSet event set}containing an instance of this class will be added
                  to the VM&apos;s event queue.
