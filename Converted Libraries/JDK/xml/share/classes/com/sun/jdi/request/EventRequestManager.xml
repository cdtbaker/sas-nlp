                  A &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;value of {@link com.sun.jdi.request.StepRequest#STEP_MIN} will generate a
                  step event each time the code index changes. It represents the
                  smallest step size available and often maps to the instruction
                  level.
                  A &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; value of {@link com.sun.jdi.request.StepRequest#STEP_LINE} will generate a
                  step event each time the source line changes unless line number information is not available,
                  in which case a STEP_MIN will be done instead.  For example, no line number information is
                  available during the execution of a method that has been rendered obsolete by
                  by a {@link com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine#redefineClasses} operation.
                  A &lt;code&gt;depth&lt;/code&gt; value of {@link com.sun.jdi.request.StepRequest#STEP_INTO} will generate

                  of {@link com.sun.jdi.request.StepRequest#STEP_OVER} restricts step events to the current frame
                  or caller frames. A &lt;code&gt;depth&lt;/code&gt; value of {@link com.sun.jdi.request.StepRequest#STEP_OUT}restricts step events to caller frames only. All depth
                  restrictions are relative to the call stack immediately before the
                  step takes place.
                  &lt;p&gt;

                Return an unmodifiable list of the enabled and disabled VM death requests.
                  This list is a live view of these requests and thus changes as requests
                  are added and deleted.
                  Note: the unsolicited VMDeathEvent does not have a
                  corresponding request.
