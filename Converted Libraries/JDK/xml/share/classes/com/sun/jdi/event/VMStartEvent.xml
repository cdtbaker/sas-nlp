                Notification of initialization of a target VM.  This event is
                  received before the main thread is started and before any
                  application code has been executed. Before this event occurs
                  a significant amount of system code has executed and a number
                  of system classes have been loaded.
                  This event is always generated by the target VM, even
                  if not explicitly requested.
