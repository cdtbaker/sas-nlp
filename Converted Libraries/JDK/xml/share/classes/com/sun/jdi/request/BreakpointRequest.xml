                Identifies a {@link Location} in the target VM at which
                  execution should be stopped. When an enabled BreakpointRequest is
                  satisfied, an{@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet event set} containing an{@link com.sun.jdi.event.BreakpointEvent BreakpointEvent}will be placed on the{@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue EventQueue} and
                  the application is interrupted. The collection of existing breakpoints is
                  managed by the {@link EventRequestManager}
