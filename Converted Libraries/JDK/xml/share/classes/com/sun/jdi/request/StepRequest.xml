                Request for notification when a step occurs in the target VM.
                  When an enabled StepRequest is satisfied, an{@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet event set} containing a{@link com.sun.jdi.event.StepEvent StepEvent} will be placed on the{@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue EventQueue}.
                  The collection of existing StepRequests is
                  managed by the {@link EventRequestManager}
