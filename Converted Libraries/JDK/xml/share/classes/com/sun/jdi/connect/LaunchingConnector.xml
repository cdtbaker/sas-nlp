                Launches an application and connects to its VM. Properties
                  of the launch (possibly including options,
                  main class, and arguments) are specified in
                  &lt;code&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt;.
                  The argument map associates argument name strings to instances
                  of {@link Connector.Argument}. The default argument map for a
                  connector can be obtained through {@link Connector#defaultArguments}.
                  Argument map values can be changed, but map entries should not be
                  added or deleted.
                  &lt;p&gt;A target VM launched by a launching connector is not
                  guaranteed to be stable until after the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.VMStartEvent} has been
                  received.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  &lt;b&gt;Important note:&lt;/b&gt; If a target VM is launched through this
                  funcctions, its output and error streams must be read as it
                  executes. These streams are available through the{@link java.lang.Process Process} object returned by{@link com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine#process}. If the streams are not periodically
                  read, the target VM will stop executing when the buffers for these
                  streams are filled.                
                <param>
                    arguments the argument map to be used in launching the VM.

                <return>
                    the {@link VirtualMachine} mirror of the target VM.                    
                </return>
                <throws>
                    java.io.IOException when unable to launch.
                      Specific exceptions are dependent on the Connector implementation
                      in use.
