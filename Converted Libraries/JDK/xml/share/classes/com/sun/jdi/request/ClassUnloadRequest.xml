                Request for notification when a class is unloaded in the target VM.
                  When an enabled ClassUnloadRequest is satisfied, a{@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet event set} containing an{@link com.sun.jdi.event.ClassUnloadEvent ClassUnloadEvent} will
                  be placed on the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue EventQueue}.
                  The collection of existing ClassUnloadRequests is
                  managed by the {@link EventRequestManager}&lt;p&gt;
