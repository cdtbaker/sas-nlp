                Notification of target VM termination.
                  This event occurs if the target VM terminates before the
                  VM disconnects ({@link VMDisconnectEvent}).
                  Thus, this event will NOT occur if
                  external forces terminate the connection (e.g. a crash)
                  or if the connection is intentionally terminated with{@link com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine#dispose()VirtualMachine.dispose()}&lt;P&gt;
                  On VM termination, a single unsolicited VMDeathEvent
                  will always be sent with a{@link com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequest#suspendPolicy() suspend policy}of {@link com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequest#SUSPEND_NONE SUSPEND_NONE}.
                  Additional VMDeathEvents will be sent in the same event set if they are
                  requested with a{@link com.sun.jdi.request.VMDeathRequest VMDeathRequest}.
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  The VM is still intact and can be queried at the point this
                  event was initiated but immediately thereafter it is not
                  considered intact and cannot be queried.
                  Note: If the enclosing {@link EventSet} has a{@link com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequest#suspendPolicy() suspend policy}other than{@link com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequest#SUSPEND_ALL SUSPEND_ALL}the initiating point may be long past.
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  All VMDeathEvents will be in a single {@link EventSet},
                  no other events will be in the event set.  A resume
                  must occur to continue execution after any event set which
                  performs suspensions - in this case to allow proper shutdown.
