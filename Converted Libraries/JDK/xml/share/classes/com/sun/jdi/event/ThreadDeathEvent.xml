                Notification of a completed thread in the target VM. The
                  notification is generated by the dying thread before it terminates.
                  Because of this timing, it is possible
                  for {@link VirtualMachine#allThreads} to return this thread
                  after this event is received.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Note that this event gives no information
                  about the lifetime of the thread object. It may or may not be collected
                  soon depending on what references exist in the target VM.
