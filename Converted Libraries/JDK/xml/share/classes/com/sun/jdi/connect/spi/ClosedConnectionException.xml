                This exception may be thrown as a result of an asynchronous
                  close of a {@link Connection} while an I/O operation is
                  in progress.
                  &lt;p&gt; When a thread is blocked in {@link Connection#readPacketreadPacket} waiting for packet from a target VM the{@link Connection} may be closed asynchronous by another
                  thread invokving the {@link Connection#close close} method.
                  When this arises the thread in readPacket will throw this
                  exception. Similiarly when a thread is blocked in{@link Connection#writePacket} the Connection may be closed.
                  When this occurs the thread in writePacket will throw
                  this exception.
