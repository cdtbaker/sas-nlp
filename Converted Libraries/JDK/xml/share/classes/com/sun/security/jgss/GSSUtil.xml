                Use this method to convert a GSSName and GSSCredential into a
                  Subject. Typically this would be done by a server that wants to
                  impersonate a client thread at the Java level by setting a client
                  Subject in the current access control context. If the server is merely
                  interested in using a principal based policy in its local JVM, then
                  it only needs to provide the GSSName of the client.
                  The elements from the GSSName are placed in the principals set of this
                  Subject and those from the GSSCredential are placed in the private
                  credentials set of the Subject. Any Kerberos specific elements that
                  are added to the subject will be instances of the standard Kerberos
                  implementation classes defined in javax.security.auth.kerberos.                
                <return>
                    a Subject with the entries that contain elements from the
                      given GSSName and GSSCredential.                    
                </return>
                <param>
                    principals a GSSName containing one or more mechanism specific
                      representations of the same entity. These mechanism specific
                      representations will be populated in the returned Subject&apos;s principal
                      set.                    
                </param>
                <param>
                    credentials a GSSCredential containing one or more mechanism
                      specific credentials for the same entity. These mechanism specific
                      credentials will be populated in the returned Subject&apos;s private
                      credential set. Passing in a value of null will imply that the private
                      credential set should be left empty.
