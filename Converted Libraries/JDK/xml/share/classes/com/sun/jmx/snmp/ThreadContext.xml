                The context of a thread is stored as a linked list.  At the
                head of the list is the value returned by localContext.get().
                At the tail of the list is a sentinel ThreadContext value with
                &quot;previous&quot; and &quot;key&quot; both null.  There is a different sentinel
                object for each thread.
                
                Because a null key indicates the sentinel, we reject attempts to
                push context entries with a null key.
                
                The reason for using a sentinel rather than just terminating
                the list with a null reference is to protect against incorrect
                or even malicious code.  If you have a reference to the
                sentinel value, you can erase the context stack.  Only the
                caller of the first &quot;push&quot; that put something on the stack can
                get such a reference, so if that caller does not give this
                reference away, no one else can erase the stack.
                
                If the restore method took a null reference to mean an empty
                stack, anyone could erase the stack, since anyone can make a
                null reference.
                
                When the stack is empty, we discard the sentinel object and
                have localContext.get() return null.  Then we recreate the
                sentinel object on the first subsequent push.
                
                ThreadContext objects are immutable.  As a consequence, you can
                give a ThreadContext object to setInitialContext that is no
                longer current.  But the interface says this can be rejected,

                  &lt;p&gt;This class associates a context with each thread that
                  references it.  The context is a set of mappings between Strings
                  and Objects.  It is managed as a stack, typically with code like
                  this:&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  ThreadContext oldContext = ThreadContext.push(myKey, myObject);
                  // plus possibly further calls to ThreadContext.push...
                  try {
                  doSomeOperation();
                  } finally {

                  &lt;code&gt;doSomeOperation&lt;/code&gt; terminates abnormally (with an
                  exception).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;A thread can consult its own context using
                  &lt;code&gt;ThreadContext.get(myKey)&lt;/code&gt;.  The result is the
                  value that was most recently pushed with the given key.&lt;/p&gt;

                    We rely on the fact that ThreadContext objects are immutable.
                    This means that we don&apos;t have to check that the &quot;context&quot;
