                A class that represents an SCTP association.
                  &lt;P&gt; An association exists between two SCTP endpoints. Each endpoint is
                  represented by a list of transport addresses through which that endpoint can
                  be reached and from which it will originate SCTP messages. The association
                  spans over all of the possible source/destination combinations which may be
                  generated from each endpoint&apos;s lists of addresses.
                  &lt;P&gt; Associations are identified by their Association ID.
                  Association ID&apos;s are guaranteed to be unique for the lifetime of the
                  association. An association ID may be reused after the association has been
                  shutdown. An association ID is not unique across multiple SCTP channels.
                  An Association&apos;s local and remote addresses may change if the SCTP
                  implementation supports &lt;I&gt;Dynamic Address Reconfiguration&lt;/I&gt; as defined by
                  &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5061&quot;&gt;RFC5061&lt;/A&gt;, see the{@code bindAddress} and {@code unbindAddress} methods of {@link SctpChannel},{@link SctpServerChannel}, and {@link SctpMultiChannel}.
                  &lt;P&gt; An {@code Association} is returned from an {@link SctpChannel#association SctpChannel} or an {@link SctpMultiChannel#associations SctpMultiChannel}, as well
                  as being given as a parameter to {@link NotificationHandlerNotificationHandler} methods.
