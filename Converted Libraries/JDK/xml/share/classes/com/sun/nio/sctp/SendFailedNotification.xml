                Notification emitted when a send failed notification has been received.
                  &lt;P&gt; A send failed notification indicates that a message cannot be delivered.
                  Typically this is because the association has been shutdown with unsent data
                  in the socket output buffer, or in the case of a {@link SctpMultiChannel}the association failed to setup.
