                Fragmented interleave controls how the presentation of messages occur
                  for the message receiver. There are three levels of fragment interleave
                  defined. Two of the levels effect {@link SctpChannel}, while{@link SctpMultiChannel} is effected by all three levels.
                  &lt;P&gt; This option takes an {@code Integer} value. It can be set to a value
                  of {@code 0}, {@code 1} or {@code 2}.
                  &lt;P&gt; Setting the three levels provides the following receiver
                  interactions:
                  &lt;P&gt; {@code level 0} - Prevents the interleaving of any messages. This
                  means that when a partial delivery begins, no other messages will be
                  received except the message being partially delivered. If another message
                  arrives on a different stream (or association) that could be delivered,
                  it will be blocked waiting for the user to read all of the partially
                  delivered message.
                  &lt;P&gt; {@code level 1} - Allows interleaving of messages that are from
                  different associations. For {@code SctpChannel}, level 0 and
                  level 1 have the same meaning since an {@code SctpChannel} always
                  receives messages from the same association. Note that setting an {@codeSctpMultiChannel} to this level may cause multiple partial
                  delivers from different associations but for any given association, only
                  one message will be delivered until all parts of a message have been
                  delivered. This means that one large message, being read with an
                  association identification of &quot;X&quot;, will block other messages from
                  association &quot;X&quot; from being delivered.
                  &lt;P&gt; {@code level 2} - Allows complete interleaving of messages. This
                  level requires that the sender carefully observe not only the peer{@code Association} but also must pay careful attention to the stream
                  number. With this option enabled a partially delivered message may begin
                  being delivered for association &quot;X&quot; stream &quot;Y&quot; and the next subsequent
                  receive may return a message from association &quot;X&quot; stream &quot;Z&quot;. Note that
                  no other messages would be delivered for association &quot;X&quot; stream &quot;Y&quot;
                  until all of stream &quot;Y&quot;&apos;s partially delivered message was read.
                  Note that this option effects both channel types.  Also note that
                  for an {@code SctpMultiChannel} not only may another streams
                  message from the same association be delivered from the next receive,
                  some other associations message may be delivered upon the next receive.
                  &lt;P&gt; It is implementation specific whether or not this option is
                  supported.

                  &lt;P&gt; In all cases the value set by this option is used in the negotiation

                  with the peer can be retrieved from the appropriate {@link Association}. The {@code Association} can be retrieved from the{@link AssociationChangeNotification.AssocChangeEvent#COMM_UP COMM_UP}{@link AssociationChangeNotification} belonging to that association.
                  &lt;p&gt; This value is bounded by the actual implementation. In other
                  words the user may be able to support more streams than the Operating

                  value requested by the user. The default value of 0 indicates to use
                  the endpoints default value.
