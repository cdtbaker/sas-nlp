                Represents a connection that is managed in a pool. The connection
                  may be reused by multiple clients.
                  A pooled connection typically has a close method that its clients
                  use to indicate that they no longer need the connection. This close
                  method would interact with the connection pool to return the connection
                  to the pool (see PoolCallback).
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The pooled connection also needs to provide a close method that the
                  connection pool can use to physically close the connection.
                  The pool might need to physically close the connection as determined
                  by the pool&apos;s policy (for example, to manage the pool size or idle
                  connections). This second close method should not use PoolCallback
                  methods. It should only do what is required to close the physical
                  connection.
