                  This method is typically called by list-style methods
                  in which the target context implementing list() expects an
                  empty name. For example when c_list() is given a non-empty name to
                  process, it would resolve that name, and then call setContinue()
                  with the resolved object so that the target context to be listed
                  would be called with the empty name (i.e. list the target context itself).

                  This method is typically called by a method that has been asked
                  to operate on a name. The method resolves part of the name
