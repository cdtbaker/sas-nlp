                Represents a callback used to release or remove a PooledConnection back
                  into the pool.
                  A pooled connection typically has a close method that its clients
                  use to indicate that they no longer need the connection. This close
                  method should use the methods defined in this interface to
                  interact with the connection pool to return the connection
                  to the pool.
                  The methods in this interface are typically invoked by a PooledConnection.
                  The methods in this interface are typically implemented by the connection
                  pool manager.
