                This interface defines the set of calls that pipeline objects
                  can use to pass on responsibility for filling various basic
                  geometric figures defined by explicit integer coordinates.
                  Typically this interface will be used for communication when
                  the coordinates of the rendering have been narrowed down to
                  actual device pixels, or for communication of untransformed
                  coordinates when the coordinates were specified using integers.
                  This interface does not cover all of the rendering calls that
                  are possible in Graphics since many of the rendering calls can
                  be transformed into one or more variants of these calls.
