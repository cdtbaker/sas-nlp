                An interface for receiving notifications about imminent accelerated device&apos;s
                  events. Upon receiving such event appropriate actions can be taken (for
                  example, resources associated with the device can be freed).

                Called when the device is about to be reset.
                  One must release all native resources associated with the device which
                  prevent the device from being reset (such as Default Pool resources for
                  the D3D pipeline).
                  It is safe to remove the listener while in the call back.

                  do not call into user code, do not take RQ lock!
