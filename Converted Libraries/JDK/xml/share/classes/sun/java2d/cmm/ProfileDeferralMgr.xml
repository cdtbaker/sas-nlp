                A class to manage the deferral of CMM initialization of profile
                  data for internal ICC_Profile objects - i.e. when we &quot;trust&quot; that
                  the profile data is valid and we think it may not be needed.  An
                  example is the sRGB profile which gets loaded by any program doing
                  graphics, but which may not be needed if the program does not need
                  high quality color conversion.

                    Ignore profile activation error for now:
                     such exception is pssible due to absence
                     or corruption of standard color profile.
                     As for now we expect all profiles should
                     be shiped with jre and presence of this
                     exception is indication of some configuration
                     problem in jre installation.
                    
                     NB: we still are greedy loading deferred profiles
                     and load them all if any of them is needed.
                     Therefore broken profile (if any) might be never used.
                     If there will be attempt to use broken profile then
                     it will result in CMMException.
