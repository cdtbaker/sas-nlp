                This factory creates platform specific VolatileSurfaceManager
                  implementations.
                  There are two platform specific SurfaceManagerFactories in OpenJDK,
                  UnixSurfaceManagerFactory and WindowsSurfaceManagerFactory.
                  The actually used SurfaceManagerFactory is set by the respective platform
                  GraphicsEnvironment implementations in the static initializer.
