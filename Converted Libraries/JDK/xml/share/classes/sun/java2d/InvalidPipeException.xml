                Signals that some part of a graphics pipeline is not in an appropriate
                  state for the requested operation.  The most likely cause of this is
                  an asynchronous change to the configuration of the destination surface
                  since the current set of rendering loops was chosen.  Other potential
                  causes are the appearance or disappearance of overlapping opaque
                  windows which toggle the need to use platform graphics or direct
                  graphics access.
