                This class represents an Java class declaration. It refers
                  to either a binary or source definition.
                  ClassDefinitions are loaded on demand, this means that
                  class declarations are late bound. The definition of the
                  class is obtained in stages. The status field describes
                  the state of the class definition:
                  CS_UNDEFINED - the definition is not yet loaded
                  CS_UNDECIDED - a binary definition is loaded, but it is
                  still unclear if the source definition need to
                  be loaded
                  CS_BINARY    - the binary class is loaded
                  CS_PARSED    - the class is loaded from the source file, the
                  type information is available, but the class has
                  not yet been compiled.
                  CS_CHECKED   - the class is loaded from the source file and has
                  been type-checked.
                  CS_COMPILED  - the class has been type checked, compiled,
                  and written out.
                  CS_NOTFOUND  - no class definition could be found

                    The majority of calls to getClassDefinition() are duplicates.
                     This check makes them fast.  It also allows us to avoid
                     duplicate, useless calls to basicCheck().  In the future it
                     would be good to add an additional status value, CS_BASICCHECKED.

                    The status states can be considered ordered in the same
                     manner as their numerical values. We expect classes to
                     progress through a sequence of monotonically increasing
                     states. NOTE: There are currently exceptions to this rule
                     which are believed to be legitimate.  In particular, a
                     class may be checked more than once, though we believe that
                     this is unnecessary and may be avoided.
