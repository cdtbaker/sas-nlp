                This is the protocol by which a Parser makes callbacks
                  to the later phases of the compiler.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  (As a backwards compatibility trick, Parser implements
                  this protocol, so that an instance of a Parser subclass
                  can handle its own actions.  The preferred way to use a
                  Parser, however, is to instantiate it directly with a
                  reference to your own ParserActions implementation.)
