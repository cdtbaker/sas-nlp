                    Not a backslash, so copy and continue
                     Always pass non backslash chars straight thru
                     for regular encoding. If backslash occurs in
                     input stream at the final 5 chars then don&apos;t
                     attempt to read-ahead and de-escape since these
                     are literal occurrences of U+005C which need to
                     be encoded verbatim in the target encoding.
