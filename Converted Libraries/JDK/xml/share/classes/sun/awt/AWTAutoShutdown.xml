                This class is to let AWT shutdown automatically when a user is done
                  with AWT. It tracks AWT state using the following parameters:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;peerMap&lt;/code&gt; - the map between the existing peer objects
                  and their associated targets
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;toolkitThreadBusy&lt;/code&gt; - whether the toolkit thread
                  is waiting for a new native event to appear in its queue
                  or is dispatching an event
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;busyThreadSet&lt;/code&gt; - a set of all the event dispatch
                  threads that are busy at this moment, i.e. those that are not
                  waiting for a new event to appear in their event queue.
                  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                  AWT is considered to be in ready-to-shutdown state when
                  &lt;code&gt;peerMap&lt;/code&gt; is empty and &lt;code&gt;toolkitThreadBusy&lt;/code&gt;
                  is false and &lt;code&gt;busyThreadSet&lt;/code&gt; is empty.
                  The internal AWTAutoShutdown logic secures that the single non-daemon
                  thread (&lt;code&gt;blockerThread&lt;/code&gt;) is running when AWT is not in
                  ready-to-shutdown state. This blocker thread is to prevent AWT from
                  exiting since the toolkit thread is now daemon and all the event
                  dispatch threads are started only when needed. Once it is detected
                  that AWT is in ready-to-shutdown state this blocker thread waits
                  for a certain timeout and if AWT state doesn&apos;t change during timeout
                  this blocker thread terminates all the event dispatch threads and
                  exits.
