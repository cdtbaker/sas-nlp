                This class represents FocusEvents with a known &quot;cause&quot; - reason why this event happened. It can
                  be mouse press, traversal, activation, and so on - all causes are described as Cause enum. The
                  event with the cause can be constructed in two ways - explicitly through constructor of
                  CausedFocusEvent class or implicitly, by calling appropriate requestFocusXXX method with &quot;cause&quot;
                  parameter. The default cause is UNKNOWN.
