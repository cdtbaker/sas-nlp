                This interface allows the ImageFetcher class to drive the production
                  of image data in an ImageProducer class by calling the doFetch()
                  method from one of a pool of threads which are created to facilitate
                  asynchronous delivery of image data outside of the standard system
                  threads which manage the applications User Interface.

                  the flow of information from the ImageProducer to the ImageConsumer.
