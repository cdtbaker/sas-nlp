                This SurfaceManager variant manages an unaccelerated volatile surface.
                  This class is created in the event that someone requested a VolatileImage
                  to be created from a BufferedImageGraphicsConfig, which is not platform-
                  or hardware-based, thus the resulting surface and surface manager
                  are unaccelerated.  All we do in this class is implement the abstract
                  methods of VolatileSurfaceManager to return values that indicate that
                  we cannot accelerate surfaces through this SurfaceManager, thus the
                  parent class will handle things through the unaccelerated backup mechanism.

                This constructor simply defers to the superclass since all of the real
                  functionality of this class is implemented in VolatileSurfaceManager.

                  Note that this method should not ever be called since creation of
                  accelerated surfaces should be preceded by calls to the above
                  isAccelerationEnabled() method.  But we need to override this method
                  since it is abstract in our parent class.
