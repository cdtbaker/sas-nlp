                The listener interface for receiving display change events.
                  The class that is interested in processing a display change event
                  implements this interface (and all the methods it
                  contains).
                  For Motif, this interface is only used for dragging windows between Xinerama
                  screens.
                  For win32, the listener object created from that class is then registered
                  with the WToolkit object using its &lt;code&gt;addDisplayChangeListener&lt;/code&gt;
                  method. When the display resolution is changed (which occurs,
                  in Windows, either by the user changing the properties of the
                  display through the control panel or other utility or by
                  some other application which has gotten fullscreen-exclusive
                  control of the display), the listener is notified through its
                  displayChanged() or paletteChanged() methods.
