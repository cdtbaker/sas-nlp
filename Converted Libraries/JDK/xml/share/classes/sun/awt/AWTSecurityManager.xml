                The AWTSecurityManager class provides the ability to secondarily
                  index AppContext objects through SecurityManager extensions.
                  As noted in AppContext.java, AppContexts are primarily indexed by
                  ThreadGroup.  In the case where the ThreadGroup doesn&apos;t provide
                  enough information to determine AppContext (e.g. system threads),
                  if a SecurityManager is installed which derives from
                  AWTSecurityManager, the AWTSecurityManager&apos;s getAppContext()
                  method is called to determine the AppContext.
                  A typical example of the use of this class is where an applet
                  is called by a system thread, yet the system AppContext is
                  inappropriate, because applet code is currently executing.
                  In this case, the getAppContext() method can walk the call stack
                  to determine the applet code being executed and return the applet&apos;s
                  AppContext object.

                Get the AppContext corresponding to the current context.
                  The default implementation returns null, but this method
                  may be overridden by various SecurityManagers
                  (e.g. AppletSecurity) to index AppContext objects by the
                  calling context.
