                This interface can be implemented on a Graphics object to allow
                  the lightweight component code to permanently install a rectangular
                  maximum clip that cannot be extended with setClip and which works in
                  conjunction with the hit() and getTransform() methods of Graphics2D
                  to make it appear as if there really was a component with these
                  dimensions.

                Constrain this graphics object to have a permanent device space
                  origin of (x, y) and a permanent maximum clip of (x,y,w,h).
                  Calling this method is roughly equivalent to:
                  g.translate(x, y);
                  g.clipRect(0, 0, w, h);
                  except that the clip can never be extended outside of these
                  bounds, even with setClip() and for the fact that the (x,y)
                  become a new device space coordinate origin.
                  These methods are recursive so that you can further restrict
                  the object by calling the constrain() method more times, but
                  you can never enlarge its restricted maximum clip.
