                An empty class in an empty package.
                  Used as a proxy for unprivileged code, since making access checks
                  against it will only succeed against public methods in public types.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  This class also stands (internally to sun.invoke) for the type of a
                  value that cannot be produced, because the expression of this type
                  always returns abnormally.  (Cf. Nothing in the closures proposal.)
