                Implementation of an SSL socket factory.  This provides the public
                  hooks to create SSL sockets, using a &quot;high level&quot; programming
                  interface which encapsulates system security policy defaults rather than
                  offering application flexibility.  In particular, it uses a configurable
                  authentication context (and the keys held there) rather than offering
                  any flexibility about which keys to use; that context defaults to the
                  process-default context, but may be explicitly specified.
