        <interface name="GSSContextSpi">
            <javadoc line="7">
                This interface is implemented by a mechanism specific instance of a GSS
                  security context.
                  A GSSContextSpi object can be thought of having 3 states:
                  -before initialization
                  -during initialization with its peer
                  -after it is established
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The context options can only be requested in state 1. In state 3,
                  the per message operations are available to the callers. The get
                  methods for the context options will return the requested options
                  while in state 1 and 2, and the established values in state 3.
                  Some mechanisms may allow the access to the per-message operations
                  and the context flags before the context is fully established. The
                  isProtReady method is used to indicate that these services are
                  available.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  &lt;strong&gt;
                  Context establishment tokens are defined in a mechanism independent
                  format in section 3.1 of RFC 2743. The GSS-Framework will add
                  and remove the mechanism independent header portion of this token format
                  depending on whether a token is received or is being sent. The mechanism
                  should only generate or expect to read the inner-context token portion..
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  On the other hands, tokens used for per-message calls are generated
                  entirely by the mechanism. It is possible that the mechanism chooses to
                  encase inner-level per-message tokens in a header similar to that used
                  for initial tokens, however, this is upto the mechanism to do. The token
                  to/from the per-message calls are opaque to the GSS-Framework.
                  &lt;/strong&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  An attempt has been made to allow for reading the peer&apos;s tokens from an
                  InputStream and writing tokens for the peer to an OutputStream. This
                  allows applications to pass in streams that are obtained from their network
                  connections and thus minimize the buffer copies that will happen. This
                  is especially important for tokens generated by wrap() which are
                  proportional in size to the length of the application data being
                  wrapped, and are probably also the most frequently used type of tokens.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  It is anticipated that most applications will want to use wrap() in a
                  fashion where they obtain the application bytes to wrap from a byte[]
                  but want to output the wrap token straight to an
                  OutputStream. Similarly, they will want to use unwrap() where they read
                  the token directly form an InputStream but output it to some byte[] for
                  the application to process. Unfortunately the high level GSS bindings
                  do not contain overloaded forms of wrap() and unwrap() that do just
                  this, however we have accomodated those cases here with the expectation
                  that this will be rolled into the high level bindings sooner or later.
