                This interface is used only for tagging keys for client properties
                  for {@code JComponent} set by UI which needs to be cleared on L&amp;F
                  change and serialization.
                  All such keys are removed from client properties in {@codeJComponent.setUI()} method after uninstalling old UI and before
                  intalling the new one. They are also removed prior to serialization.
