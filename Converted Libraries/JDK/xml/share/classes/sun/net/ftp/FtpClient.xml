                  Which includes support for FTP over SSL/TLS (aka ftps).{@code FtpClient} provides all the functionalities of a typical FTP
                  client, like storing or retrieving files, listing or creating directories.
                  A typical usage would consist of connecting the client to the server,
                  log in, issue a few commands then logout.
                  Here is a code example:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  FtpClient cl = FtpClient.create();
                  cl.connect(&quot;ftp.gnu.org&quot;).login(&quot;anonymous&quot;, &quot;john.doe@mydomain.com&quot;.toCharArray())).changeDirectory(&quot;pub/gnu&quot;);
                  Iterator&amp;lt;FtpDirEntry&amp;gt; dir = cl.listFiles();
                  while (dir.hasNext()) {
                  FtpDirEntry f = dir.next();
                  System.err.println(f.getName());
                  }
                  cl.close();
                  }
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Error reporting:&lt;/b&gt; There are, mostly, two families of errors that
                  can occur during an FTP session. The first kind are the network related issues
                  like a connection reset, and they are usually fatal to the session, meaning,
                  in all likelyhood the connection to the server has been lost and the session
                  should be restarted from scratch. These errors are reported by throwing an{@link IOException}. The second kind are the errors reported by the FTP server,
                  like when trying to download a non-existing file for example. These errors
                  are usually non fatal to the session, meaning more commands can be sent to the
                  server. In these cases, a {@link FtpProtocolException} is thrown.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  It should be noted that this is not a thread-safe API, as it wouldn&apos;t make
                  too much sense, due to the very sequential nature of FTP, to provide a
                  client able to be manipulated from multiple threads.

                  data connections are established by having the client connect to the server.
                  This is the recommended default mode as it will work best through
                  firewalls and NATs. If set to {@code false} the mode is said to be
                  &lt;I&gt;active&lt;/I&gt; which means the server will connect back to the client
                  after a PORT command to establish a data connection.
                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Since the passive mode might not be supported by all
                  FTP servers, enabling it means the client will try to use it. If the
                  server rejects it, then the client will attempt to fall back to using
                  the &lt;I&gt;active&lt;/I&gt; mode by issuing a {@code PORT} command instead.&lt;/p&gt;

            <javadoc line="610">
                Some methods do not wait until completion before returning, so this
                  method can be called to wait until completion. This is typically the case
                  with commands that trigger a transfer like {@link #getFileStream(String)}.
                  So this method should be called before accessing information related to
                  such a command.
                  &lt;p&gt;This method will actually block reading on the command channel for a
                  notification from the server that the command is finished. Such a
                  notification often carries extra information concerning the completion
                  of the pending action (e.g. number of bytes transfered).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Note that this will return immediately if no command or action
                  is pending&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;It should be also noted that most methods issuing commands to the ftp
                  server will call this method if a previous command is pending.
                  &lt;p&gt;Example of use:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  InputStream in = cl.getFileStream(&quot;file&quot;);
                  ...
                  cl.completePending();
                  long size = cl.getLastTransferSize();
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
                  On the other hand, it&apos;s not necessary in a case like:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  InputStream in = cl.getFileStream(&quot;file&quot;);
                  // read content
                  ...
                  cl.close();
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Since {@link #close()} will call completePending() if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
