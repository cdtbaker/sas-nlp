                Default break-iterator rules.  These rules are more or less general for
                  all locales, although there are probably a few we&apos;re missing.  The
                  behavior currently mimics the behavior of BreakIterator in JDK 1.2.
                  There are known deficiencies in this behavior, including the fact that
                  the logic for handling CJK characters works for Japanese but not for
                  Chinese, and that we don&apos;t currently have an appropriate locale for
                  Thai.  The resources will eventually be updated to fix these problems.
