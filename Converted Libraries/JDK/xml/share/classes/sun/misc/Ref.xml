                A &quot;Ref&quot; is an indirect reference to an object that the garbage collector
                  knows about.  An application should override the reconstitute() method with one
                  that will construct the object based on information in the Ref, often by
                  reading from a file.  The get() method retains a cache of the result of the last call to
                  reconstitute() in the Ref.  When space gets tight, the garbage collector
                  will clear old Ref cache entries when there are no other pointers to the
                  object.  In normal usage, Ref will always be subclassed.  The subclass will add the
                  instance variables necessary for the reconstitute() method to work.  It will also add a
                  constructor to set them up, and write a version of reconstitute().

                  reconstituted. This method does everything necessary to ensure that the garbage
