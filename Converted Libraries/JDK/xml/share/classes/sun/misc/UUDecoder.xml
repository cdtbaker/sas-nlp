                This class implements a Berkeley uu character decoder. This decoder
                  was made famous by the uudecode program.
                  The basic character coding is algorithmic, taking 6 bits of binary
                  data and adding it to an ASCII &apos; &apos; (space) character. This converts
                  these six bits into a printable representation. Note that it depends
                  on the ASCII character encoding standard for english. Groups of three
                  bytes are converted into 4 characters by treating the three bytes
                  a four 6 bit groups, group 1 is byte 1&apos;s most significant six bits,
                  group 2 is byte 1&apos;s least significant two bits plus byte 2&apos;s four
                  most significant bits. etc.
                  In this encoding, the buffer prefix is:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  begin [mode] [filename]
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
                  This is followed by one or more lines of the form:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  (len)(data)(data)(data) ...
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
                  where (len) is the number of bytes on this line. Note that groupings
                  are always four characters, even if length is not a multiple of three
                  bytes. When less than three characters are encoded, the values of the
                  last remaining bytes is undefined and should be ignored.
                  The last line of data in a uuencoded buffer is represented by a single
                  space character. This is translated by the decoding engine to a line
                  length of zero. This is immediately followed by a line which contains
                  the word &apos;end[newline]&apos;
                  If an error is encountered during decoding this class throws a
                  CEFormatException. The specific detail messages are:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  &quot;UUDecoder: No begin line.&quot;
                  &quot;UUDecoder: Malformed begin line.&quot;
                  &quot;UUDecoder: Short Buffer.&quot;
                  &quot;UUDecoder: Bad Line Length.&quot;
                  &quot;UUDecoder: Missing &apos;end&apos; line.&quot;
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
