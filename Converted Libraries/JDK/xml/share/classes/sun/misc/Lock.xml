                The Lock class provides a simple, useful interface to a lock.
                  Unlike monitors which synchronize access to an object, locks
                  synchronize access to an arbitrary set of resources (objects,
                  methods, variables, etc.). &lt;p&gt;
                  The programmer using locks must be responsible for clearly defining
                  the semantics of their use and should handle deadlock avoidance in
                  the face of exceptions. &lt;p&gt;
                  For example, if you want to protect a set of method invocations with
                  a lock, and one of the methods may throw an exception, you must be
                  prepared to release the lock similarly to the following example:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  class SomeClass {
                  Lock myLock = new Lock();
                  void someMethod() {
                  myLock.lock();
                  try {
                  StartOperation();
                  ContinueOperation();
                  EndOperation();
                  } finally {
                  myLock.unlock();
                  }
                  }
                  }
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
