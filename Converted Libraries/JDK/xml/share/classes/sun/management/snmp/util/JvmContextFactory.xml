                  Allocate a contextual object containing some user data. This method
                  is called once for each incoming SNMP request. The scope
                  of this object will be the whole request. Since the request can be
                  handled in several threads, the user should make sure that this
                  object can be accessed in a thread-safe manner. The SNMP framework
                  will never access this object directly - it will simply pass
                  it to the &lt;code&gt;SnmpMibAgent&lt;/code&gt; within
                  &lt;code&gt;SnmpMibRequest&lt;/code&gt; objects - from where it can be retrieved
                  through the {@link com.sun.jmx.snmp.agent.SnmpMibRequest#getUserData() getUserData()} accessor.
                  &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; is considered to be a valid return value.
                  This method is called just after the SnmpPduPacket has been
                  decoded.                
                <param>

                  This method is called just before the responsePdu is sent back to the

                  before it is encoded, and to free any resources that might have
                  been allocated when creating the contextual object.
