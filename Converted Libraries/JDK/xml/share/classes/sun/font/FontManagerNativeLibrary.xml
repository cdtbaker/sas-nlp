                Call this method to ensure libraries are loaded.
                
                 Method acts as trigger to ensure this class is loaded
                 (and therefore initializer code is executed).
                 Actual loading is performed by static initializer.
                 (no need to execute doPrivilledged block more than once)

                            Ideally fontmanager library should not depend on
                            particular implementation of the font scaler.
                            However, freetype scaler is basically small wrapper on
                            top of freetype library (that is used in binary form).
                            
                            This wrapper is compiled into fontmanager and this make
                            fontmanger library depending on freetype library.
                            
                            On Windows DLL&apos;s in the JRE&apos;s BIN directory cannot be
                            found by windows DLL loading as that directory is not
                            on the Windows PATH.
                            
                            To avoid link error we have to load freetype explicitly
                            before we load fontmanager.
                            
                            Note that we do not need to do this for T2K because
                            fontmanager.dll does not depend on t2k.dll.
                            
                            NB: consider moving freetype wrapper part to separate
