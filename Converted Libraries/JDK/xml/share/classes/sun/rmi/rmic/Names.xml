                If necessary, convert a class name to its mangled form, i.e. the
                  non-inner class name used in the binary representation of
                  inner classes.  This is necessary to be able to name inner
                  classes in the generated source code in places where the language
                  does not permit it, such as when synthetically defining an inner
                  class outside of its outer class, and for generating file names
                  corresponding to inner classes.
                  Currently this mangling involves modifying the internal names of
                  inner classes by converting occurrences of &quot;. &quot; into &quot;$&quot;.
                  This code is taken from the &quot;mangleInnerType&quot; method of
                  the &quot;sun.tools.java.Type&quot; class; this method cannot be accessed
                  itself because it is package protected.
