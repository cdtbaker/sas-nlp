                An interface for creating instances of &lt;tt&gt;SaslClient&lt;/tt&gt;.
                  A class that implements this interface
                  must be thread-safe and handle multiple simultaneous
                  requests. It must also have a public constructor that accepts no
                  argument.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  This interface is not normally accessed directly by a client, which will use the
                  &lt;tt&gt;Sasl&lt;/tt&gt; static methods
                  instead. However, a particular environment may provide and install a
                  new or different &lt;tt&gt;SaslClientFactory&lt;/tt&gt;.

                <param>
                    mechanisms The non-null list of mechanism names to try. Each is the
                      IANA-registered name of a SASL mechanism. (e.g. "GSSAPI", "CRAM-MD5").                    
                </param>
                <param>
                    authorizationId The possibly null protocol-dependent
                      identification to be used for authorization.
                      If null or empty, the server derives an authorization
                      ID from the client's authentication credentials.
                      When the SASL authentication completes successfully,
                      the specified entity is granted access.                    
                </param>
                <param>
                    protocol The non-null string name of the protocol for which
                      the authentication is being performed (e.g., "ldap").                    
                </param>
                <param>
                    serverName The non-null fully qualified host name
                      of the server to authenticate to.                    
                </param>
                <param>
                    props The possibly null set of properties used to select the SASL
                      mechanism and to configure the authentication exchange of the selected
                      mechanism. See the <tt>Sasl</tt> class for a list of standard properties.
                      Other, possibly mechanism-specific, properties can be included.
                      Properties not relevant to the selected mechanism are ignored,
                      including any map entries with non-String keys.                    
                </param>
                <param>
                    cbh The possibly null callback handler to used by the SASL
                      mechanisms to get further information from the application/library
                      to complete the authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism might
                      require the authentication ID, password and realm from the caller.
                      The authentication ID is requested by using a <tt>NameCallback</tt>.
                      The password is requested by using a <tt>PasswordCallback</tt>.
                      The realm is requested by using a <tt>RealmChoiceCallback</tt> if there is a list
                      of realms to choose from, and by using a <tt>RealmCallback</tt> if
                      the realm must be entered.                    
                </param>
