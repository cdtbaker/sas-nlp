                The AccessibleKeyBinding interface should be supported by any object
                  that has a keyboard bindings such as a keyboard mnemonic and/or keyboard
                  shortcut which can be used to select the object.  This interface provides
                  the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine the
                  key bindings which exist for this object.
                  Any object that has such key bindings should support this
                  interface.
