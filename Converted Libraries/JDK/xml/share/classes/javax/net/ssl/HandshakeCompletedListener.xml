                This interface is implemented by any class which wants to receive
                  notifications about the completion of an SSL protocol handshake
                  on a given SSL connection.
                  &lt;P&gt; When an SSL handshake completes, new security parameters will
                  have been established.  Those parameters always include the security
                  keys used to protect messages.  They may also include parameters
                  associated with a new &lt;em&gt;session&lt;/em&gt; such as authenticated
                  peer identity and a new SSL cipher suite.
