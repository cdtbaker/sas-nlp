                Instance of this interface manage which X509 certificates
                  may be used to authenticate the remote side of a secure
                  socket. Decisions may be based on trusted certificate
                  authorities, certificate revocation lists, online
                  status checking or other means.

                  The authentication type is the key exchange algorithm portion
                  of the cipher suites represented as a String, such as &quot;RSA&quot;,
                  &quot;DHE_DSS&quot;. Note: for some exportable cipher suites, the key
                  exchange algorithm is determined at run time during the
                  handshake. For instance, for TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5,
                  the authType should be RSA_EXPORT when an ephemeral RSA key is
                  used for the key exchange, and RSA when the key from the server
                  certificate is used. Checking is case-sensitive.
