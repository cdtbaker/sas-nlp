                This interface is implemented by objects which want to know when
                  they are being bound or unbound from a SSLSession.  When either event
                  occurs via {@link SSLSession#putValue(String,Object)}or {@link SSLSession#removeValue(String)}, the event is communicated
                  through a SSLSessionBindingEvent identifying the session.
