                This exception is thrown when there is a configuration problem.
                  This can arise when installation of a provider was
                  not done correctly, or if there are configuration problems with the
                  server, or if configuration information required to access
                  the provider or service is malformed or missing.
                  For example, a request to use SSL as the security protocol when
                  the service provider software was not configured with the SSL
                  component would cause such an exception. Another example is
                  if the provider requires that a URL be specified as one of the
                  environment properties but the client failed to provide it.
                  &lt;p&gt;
