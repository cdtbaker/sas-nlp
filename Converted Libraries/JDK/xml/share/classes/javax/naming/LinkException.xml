                This exception is used to describe problems encounter while resolving links.
                  Addition information is added to the base NamingException for pinpointing
                  the problem with the link.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Analogous to how NamingException captures name resolution information,
                  LinkException captures &quot;link&quot;-name resolution information pinpointing
                  the problem encountered while resolving a link. All these fields may
                  be null.
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; Link Resolved Name. Portion of link name that has been resolved.
                  &lt;li&gt; Link Resolved Object. Object to which resolution of link name proceeded.
                  &lt;li&gt; Link Remaining Name. Portion of link name that has not been resolved.
                  &lt;li&gt; Link Explanation. Detail explaining why link resolution failed.
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A LinkException instance is not synchronized against concurrent
                  multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
                  a single LinkException instance should lock the object.
