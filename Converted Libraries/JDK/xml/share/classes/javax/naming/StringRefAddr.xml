                This class represents the string form of the address of
                  a communications end-point.
                  It consists of a type that describes the communication mechanism
                  and a string contents specific to that communication mechanism.
                  The format and interpretation of
                  the address type and the contents of the address are based on
                  the agreement of three parties: the client that uses the address,
                  the object/server that can be reached using the address, and the
                  administrator or program that creates the address.
                  &lt;p&gt; An example of a string reference address is a host name.
                  Another example of a string reference address is a URL.
                  &lt;p&gt; A string reference address is immutable:
                  once created, it cannot be changed.  Multithreaded access to
                  a single StringRefAddr need not be synchronized.
