                This interface is implemented by an object that can provide a
                  Reference to itself.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A Reference represents a way of recording address information about
                  objects which themselves are not directly bound to the naming system.
                  Such objects can implement the Referenceable interface as a way
                  for programs that use that object to determine what its Reference is.
                  For example, when binding a object, if an object implements the
                  Referenceable interface, getReference() can be invoked on the object to
                  get its Reference to use for binding.
