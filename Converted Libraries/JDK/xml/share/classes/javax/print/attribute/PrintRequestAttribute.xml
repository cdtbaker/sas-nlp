                Interface PrintRequestAttribute is a tagging interface which a printing
                  attribute class implements to indicate the attribute denotes a
                  requested setting for a print job.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Attributes which are tagged with PrintRequestAttribute and are also tagged
                  as PrintJobAttribute, represent the subset of job attributes which
                  can be part of the specification of a job request.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  If an attribute implements {@link DocAttribute  DocAttribute}as well as PrintRequestAttribute, the client may include the
                  attribute in a &lt;code&gt;Doc&lt;/code&gt;}&apos;s attribute set to specify
                  a job setting which pertains just to that doc.
