                This class extends {@link PrintService} and represents a
                  print service that prints data in different formats to a
                  client-provided output stream.
                  This is principally intended for services where
                  the output format is a document type suitable for viewing
                  or archiving.
                  The output format must be declared as a mime type.
                  This is equivalent to an output document flavor where the
                  representation class is always &quot;java.io.OutputStream&quot;
                  An instance of the &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt; class is
                  obtained from a {@link StreamPrintServiceFactory} instance.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Note that a &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt; is different from a
                  &lt;code&gt;PrintService&lt;/code&gt;, which supports a{@link javax.print.attribute.standard.Destination Destination}attribute.  A &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt; always requires an output
                  stream, whereas a &lt;code&gt;PrintService&lt;/code&gt; optionally accepts a
                  &lt;code&gt;Destination&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt;
                  has no default destination for its formatted output.
                  Additionally a &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt; is expected to generate
                  output in
                  a format useful in other contexts.
                  StreamPrintService&apos;s are not expected to support the Destination attribute.

                  If a stream service cannot be re-used, it must be disposed
                  to indicate this. Typically the client will call this method.
                  Services which write data which cannot meaningfully be appended to
                  may also dispose the stream. This does not close the stream. It
                  just marks it as not for further use by this service.
