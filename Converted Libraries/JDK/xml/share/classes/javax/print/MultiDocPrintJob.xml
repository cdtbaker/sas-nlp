                Print a MultiDoc with the specified job attributes.
                  This method should only be called once for a given print job.
                  Calling it again will not result in a new job being spooled to
                  the printer. The service implementation will define policy
                  for service interruption and recovery. Application clients which
                  want to monitor the success or failure should register a
