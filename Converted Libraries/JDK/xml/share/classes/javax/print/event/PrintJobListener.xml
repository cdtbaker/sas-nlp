                Implementations of this listener interface should be attached to a{@link javax.print.DocPrintJob DocPrintJob} to monitor the status of
                  the printer job.
                  These callback methods may be invoked on the thread processing the
                  print job, or a service created notification thread. In either case
                  the client should not perform lengthy processing in these callbacks.

                  transferred to the print service, and the client may free
                  local resources allocated for that data.  The client should
                  not assume that the data has been completely printed after
                  receiving this event.
                  If this event is not received the client should wait for a terminal
                  event (completed/canceled/failed) before freeing the resources.
