                An abstract adapter class for receiving print job events.
                  The methods in this class are empty.
                  This class exists as a convenience for creating listener objects.
                  Extend this class to create a {@link PrintJobEvent} listener and override
                  the methods for the events of interest.  Unlike the{@link java.awt.event.ComponentListener ComponentListener}interface, this abstract interface provides null methods so that you
                  only need to define the methods you need, rather than all of the methods.
