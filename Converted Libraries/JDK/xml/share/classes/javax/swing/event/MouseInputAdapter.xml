                An empty implementation of the {@code MouseInputListener} interface, provided
                  as a convenience to simplify the task of creating listeners, by extending
                  and implementing only the methods of interest. This class also provides an
                  empty implementation of the {@code MouseWheelListener} interface, through
                  its extension from AWT&apos;s {@code MouseAdapter}.
