                An event that characterizes a change in selection. The change is limited to a
                  a single inclusive interval. The selection of at least one index within the
                  range will have changed. A decent {@code ListSelectionModel} implementation
                  will keep the range as small as possible. {@code ListSelectionListeners} will
                  generally query the source of the event for the new selected status of each
                  potentially changed row.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  &lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt;
                  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
                  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
                  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
                  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
                  of all JavaBeans&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;TM&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
                  has been added to the &lt;code&gt;java.beans&lt;/code&gt; package.
