                An event that characterizes a change in the current
                  selection.  The change is based on any number of paths.
                  TreeSelectionListeners will generally query the source of
                  the event for the new selected status of each potentially
                  changed row.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  &lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt;
                  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
                  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
                  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
                  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
                  of all JavaBeans&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;TM&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
                  has been added to the &lt;code&gt;java.beans&lt;/code&gt; package.
