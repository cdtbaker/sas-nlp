                Interface for document change notifications.  This provides
                  detailed information to Document observers about how the
                  Document changed.  It provides high level information such
                  as type of change and where it occurred, as well as the more
                  detailed structural changes (What Elements were inserted and
                  removed).

            <javadoc line="73">
                Gets the change information for the given element.
                  The change information describes what elements were
                  added and removed and the location.  If there were
                  no changes, null is returned.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  This method is for observers to discover the structural
                  changes that were made.  This means that only elements
                  that existed prior to the mutation (and still exist after
                  the mutatino) need to have ElementChange records.
                  The changes made available need not be recursive.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  For example, if the an element is removed from it&apos;s
                  parent, this method should report that the parent
                  changed and provide an ElementChange implementation
                  that describes the change to the parent.  If the
                  child element removed had children, these elements
                  do not need to be reported as removed.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  If an child element is insert into a parent element,
                  the parent element should report a change.  If the
                  child element also had elements inserted into it
                  (grandchildren to the parent) these elements need
                  not report change.
