                Interface for an observer to register to receive notifications
                  of changes to a text document.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The default implementation of
                  the Document interface (AbstractDocument) supports asynchronous
                  mutations.  If this feature is used (i.e. mutations are made
                  from a thread other than the Swing event thread), the listeners
                  will be notified via the mutating thread.  &lt;em&gt;This means that
                  if asynchronous updates are made, the implementation of this
                  interface must be threadsafe&lt;/em&gt;!
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The DocumentEvent notification is based upon the JavaBeans
                  event model.  There is no guarantee about the order of delivery
                  to listeners, and all listeners must be notified prior to making
                  further mutations to the Document.  &lt;em&gt;This means implementations
                  of the DocumentListener may not mutate the source of the event
                  (i.e. the associated Document)&lt;/em&gt;.
