                A FocusTraversalPolicy which can optionally provide an algorithm for
                  determining a JInternalFrame&apos;s initial Component. The initial Component is
                  the first to receive focus when the JInternalFrame is first selected. By
                  default, this is the same as the JInternalFrame&apos;s default Component to
                  focus.

                Returns the Component that should receive the focus when a
                  JInternalFrame is selected for the first time. Once the JInternalFrame
                  has been selected by a call to &lt;code&gt;setSelected(true)&lt;/code&gt;, the
                  initial Component will not be used again. Instead, if the JInternalFrame
                  loses and subsequently regains selection, or is made invisible or
                  undisplayable and subsequently made visible and displayable, the
                  JInternalFrame&apos;s most recently focused Component will become the focus
                  owner. The default implementation of this method returns the
                  JInternalFrame&apos;s default Component to focus.
