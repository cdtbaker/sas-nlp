                Represents a location within a document.  It is intended to abstract away
                  implementation details of the document and enable specification of
                  positions within the document that are capable of tracking of change as
                  the document is edited.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A {@code Position} object points at a location between two characters.
                  As the surrounding content is altered, the {@code Position} object
                  adjusts its offset automatically to reflect the changes. If content is
                  inserted or removed before the {@code Position} object&apos;s location, then the{@code Position} increments or decrements its offset, respectively,
                  so as to point to the same location. If a portion of the document is removed
                  that contains a {@code Position}&apos;s offset, then the {@code Position}&apos;s
                  offset becomes that of the beginning of the removed region. For example, if
                  a {@code Position} has an offset of 5 and the region 2-10 is removed, then
                  the {@code Position}&apos;s offset becomes 2.
                  &lt;p&gt;{@code Position} with an offset of 0 is a special case. It never changes its
                  offset while document content is altered.

                    A typesafe enumeration to indicate bias to a position
                      in the model.  A position indicates a location between
                      two characters.  The bias can be used to indicate an
                      interest toward one of the two sides of the position
                      in boundary conditions where a simple offset is
