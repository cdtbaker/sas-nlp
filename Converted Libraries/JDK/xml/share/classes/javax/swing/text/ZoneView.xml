            <javadoc line="31">
                ZoneView is a View implementation that creates zones for which
                  the child views are not created or stored until they are needed
                  for display or model/view translations.  This enables a substantial
                  reduction in memory consumption for situations where the model
                  being represented is very large, by building view objects only for
                  the region being actively viewed/edited.  The size of the children
                  can be estimated in some way, or calculated asynchronously with
                  only the result being saved.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  ZoneView extends BoxView to provide a box that implements
                  zones for its children.  The zones are special View implementations
                  (the children of an instance of this class) that represent only a
                  portion of the model that an instance of ZoneView is responsible
                  for.  The zones don&apos;t create child views until an attempt is made
                  to display them. A box shaped view is well suited to this because:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;
                  Boxes are a heavily used view, and having a box that
                  provides this behavior gives substantial opportunity
                  to plug the behavior into a view hierarchy from the
                  view factory.
                  &lt;li&gt;
                  Boxes are tiled in one direction, so it is easy to
                  divide them into zones in a reliable way.
                  &lt;li&gt;
                  Boxes typically have a simple relationship to the model (i.e. they
                  create child views that directly represent the child elements).
                  &lt;li&gt;
                  Boxes are easier to estimate the size of than some other shapes.
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The default behavior is controled by two properties, maxZoneSize
                  and maxZonesLoaded.  Setting maxZoneSize to Integer.MAX_VALUE would
                  have the effect of causing only one zone to be created.  This would
                  effectively turn the view into an implementation of the decorator
                  pattern.  Setting maxZonesLoaded to a value of Integer.MAX_VALUE would
                  cause zones to never be unloaded.  For simplicity, zones are created on
                  boundaries represented by the child elements of the element the view is
                  responsible for.  The zones can be any View implementation, but the
                  default implementation is based upon AsyncBoxView which supports fairly
                  large zones efficiently.
