                Establishes the set of things needed by a text component
                  to be a reasonably functioning editor for some &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt;
                  of text content.  The EditorKit acts as a factory for some
                  kind of policy.  For example, an implementation
                  of html and rtf can be provided that is replaceable
                  with other implementations.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A kit can safely store editing state as an instance
                  of the kit will be dedicated to a text component.
                  New kits will normally be created by cloning a
                  prototype kit.  The kit will have it&apos;s
                  &lt;code&gt;setComponent&lt;/code&gt; method called to establish
                  it&apos;s relationship with a JTextComponent.
