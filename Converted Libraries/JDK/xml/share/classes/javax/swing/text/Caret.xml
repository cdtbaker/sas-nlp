            <javadoc line="32">
                A place within a document view that represents where
                  things can be inserted into the document model.  A caret
                  has a position in the document referred to as a dot.
                  The dot is where the caret is currently located in the
                  model.  There is
                  a second position maintained by the caret that represents
                  the other end of a selection called mark.  If there is
                  no selection the dot and mark will be equal.  If a selection
                  exists, the two values will be different.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The dot can be placed by either calling
                  &lt;code&gt;setDot&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;moveDot&lt;/code&gt;.  Setting
                  the dot has the effect of removing any selection that may
                  have previously existed.  The dot and mark will be equal.
                  Moving the dot has the effect of creating a selection as
                  the mark is left at whatever position it previously had.
