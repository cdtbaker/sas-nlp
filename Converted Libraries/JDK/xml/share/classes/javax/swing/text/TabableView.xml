                Determines the desired span when using the given
                  tab expansion implementation.  If a container
                  calls this method, it will do so prior to the
                  normal layout which would call getPreferredSpan.
                  A view implementing this should give the same
                  result in any subsequent calls to getPreferredSpan
                  along the axis of tab expansion.

                Determines the span along the same axis as tab
                  expansion for a portion of the view.  This is
                  intended for use by the TabExpander for cases
                  where the tab expansion involves aligning the
                  portion of text that doesn&apos;t have whitespace
                  relative to the tab stop.  There is therefore
                  an assumption that the range given does not
                  contain tabs.
