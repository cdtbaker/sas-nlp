                This exception is to report bad locations within a document model
                  (that is, attempts to reference a location that doesn&apos;t exist).

                  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
                  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
                  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
                  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
                  of all JavaBeans&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;TM&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
                  has been added to the &lt;code&gt;java.beans&lt;/code&gt; package.
