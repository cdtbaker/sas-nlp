                Reports that a given region of the image has been updated.
                  The application might choose to redisplay the specified area,
                  for example, in order to provide a progressive display effect,
                  or perform other incremental processing.
                  &lt;p&gt; Note that different image format readers may produce
                  decoded pixels in a variety of different orders.  Many readers
                  will produce pixels in a simple top-to-bottom,
                  left-to-right-order, but others may use multiple passes of
                  interlacing, tiling, etc.  The sequence of updates may even
                  differ from call to call depending on network speeds, for
                  example.  A call to this method does not guarantee that all the
                  specified pixels have actually been updated, only that some
                  activity has taken place within some subregion of the one
                  specified.
                  &lt;p&gt; The particular &lt;code&gt;ImageReader&lt;/code&gt; implementation may
                  choose how often to provide updates.  Each update specifies
                  that a given region of the image has been updated since the
                  last update.  A region is described by its spatial bounding box
                  (&lt;code&gt;minX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;minY&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;, and
                  &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;); X and Y subsampling factors
                  (&lt;code&gt;periodX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;periodY&lt;/code&gt;); and a set of
                  updated bands (&lt;code&gt;bands&lt;/code&gt;).  For example, the update:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  minX = 10
                  minY = 20
                  width = 3
                  height = 4
                  periodX = 2
                  periodY = 3
                  bands = { 1, 3 }
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
                  would indicate that bands 1 and 3 of the following pixels were
                  updated:
