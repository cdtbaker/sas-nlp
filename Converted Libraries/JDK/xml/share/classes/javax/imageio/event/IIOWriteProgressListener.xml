                Reports the approximate degree of completion of the current

                  &lt;code&gt;ImageWriter&lt;/code&gt;.
                  &lt;p&gt; The degree of completion is expressed as an index
                  indicating which image is being written, and a percentage
                  varying from &lt;code&gt;0.0F&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;100.0F&lt;/code&gt;
                  indicating how much of the current image has been output.  The
                  percentage should ideally be calculated in terms of the
                  remaining time to completion, but it is usually more practical
                  to use a more well-defined metric such as pixels decoded or
                  portion of input stream consumed.  In any case, a sequence of
                  calls to this method during a given read operation should
                  supply a monotonically increasing sequence of percentage
                  values.  It is not necessary to supply the exact values
                  &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt;, as these may be inferred
                  by the callee from other methods.
                  &lt;p&gt; Each particular &lt;code&gt;ImageWriter&lt;/code&gt; implementation may
                  call this method at whatever frequency it desires.  A rule of
                  thumb is to call it around each 5 percent mark.
