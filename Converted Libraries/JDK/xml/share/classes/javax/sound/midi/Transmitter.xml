                  &lt;p&gt;If the creation of this &lt;code&gt;Transmitter&lt;/code&gt; resulted in
                  implicitly opening the underlying device, the device is
                  implicitly closed by this method. This is true unless the device is
                  kept open by other &lt;code&gt;Receiver&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Transmitter&lt;/code&gt;
                  instances that opened the device implicitly, and unless the device
                  has been opened explicitly. If the device this
                  &lt;code&gt;Transmitter&lt;/code&gt; is retrieved from is closed explicitly
                  by calling {@link MidiDevice#close MidiDevice.close}, the
                  &lt;code&gt;Transmitter&lt;/code&gt; is closed, too.  For a detailed
                  description of open/close behaviour see the class description
