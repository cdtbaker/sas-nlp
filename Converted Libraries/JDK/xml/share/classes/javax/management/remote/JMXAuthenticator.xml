                &lt;p&gt;Interface to define how remote credentials are converted into a
                  JAAS Subject.  This interface is used by the RMI Connector Server,
                  and can be used by other connector servers.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;The user-defined authenticator instance is passed to the
                  connector server in the environment map as the value of the
                  attribute {@link JMXConnectorServer#AUTHENTICATOR}.  For connector
                  servers that use only this authentication system, if this attribute
                  is not present or its value is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; then no user
                  authentication will be performed and full access to the methods
                  exported by the &lt;code&gt;MBeanServerConnection&lt;/code&gt; object will be
                  allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;If authentication is successful then an authenticated{@link Subject subject} filled in with its associated{@link Principal principals} is returned. Authorization checks
                  will be then performed based on the given set of principals.&lt;/p&gt;
