                  manually this purgeRelations() method will cause trouble, as will
                  consider the ObjectName as corresponding to the unregistered MBean, not
                  seeing the new one.
                  &lt;P&gt;The behavior depends on the cardinality of the role where the
                  unregistered MBean is referenced:
                  &lt;P&gt;- if removing one MBean reference in the role makes its number of
                  references less than the minimum degree, the relation has to be removed.
                  &lt;P&gt;- if the remaining number of references after removing the MBean
                  reference is still in the cardinality range, keep the relation and
                  update it calling its handleMBeanUnregistration() callback.
