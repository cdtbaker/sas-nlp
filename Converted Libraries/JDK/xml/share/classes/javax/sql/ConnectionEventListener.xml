                  An object that registers to be notified of events generated by a
                  &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object.
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  The &lt;code&gt;ConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt; interface is implemented by a
                  connection pooling component.  A connection pooling component will
                  usually be provided by a JDBC driver vendor or another system software
                  vendor.  A JDBC driver notifies a &lt;code&gt;ConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt;
                  object when an application is finished using a pooled connection with
                  which the listener has registered.  The notification
                  occurs after the application calls the method &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; on
                  its representation of a &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object.  A
                  &lt;code&gt;ConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt; is also notified when a
                  connection error occurs due to the fact that the &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt;
                  is unfit for future use---the server has crashed, for example.
                  The listener is notified by the JDBC driver just before the driver throws an
                  &lt;code&gt;SQLException&lt;/code&gt; to the application using the
                  &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object.
