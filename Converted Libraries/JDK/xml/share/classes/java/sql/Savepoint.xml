                The representation of a savepoint, which is a point within
                  the current transaction that can be referenced from the
                  &lt;code&gt;Connection.rollback&lt;/code&gt; method. When a transaction
                  is rolled back to a savepoint all changes made after that
                  savepoint are undone.

                  Savepoints can be either named or unnamed. Unnamed savepoints
                  are identified by an ID generated by the underlying data source.
