                VolatileImage is an image which can lose its
                  contents at any time due to circumstances beyond the control of the
                  application (e.g., situations caused by the operating system or by
                  other applications). Because of the potential for hardware acceleration,
                  a VolatileImage object can have significant performance benefits on
                  some platforms.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The drawing surface of an image (the memory where the image contents
                  actually reside) can be lost or invalidated, causing the contents of that
                  memory to go away.  The drawing surface thus needs to be restored
                  or recreated and the contents of that surface need to be
                  re-rendered.  VolatileImage provides an interface for
                  allowing the user to detect these problems and fix them
                  when they occur.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  When a VolatileImage object is created, limited system resources
                  such as video memory (VRAM) may be allocated in order to support
                  the image.
                  When a VolatileImage object is no longer used, it may be
                  garbage-collected and those system resources will be returned,
                  but this process does not happen at guaranteed times.
                  Applications that create many VolatileImage objects (for example,
                  a resizing window may force recreation of its back buffer as the
                  size changes) may run out of optimal system resources for new
                  VolatileImage objects simply because the old objects have not
                  yet been removed from the system.
                  (New VolatileImage objects may still be created, but they
                  may not perform as well as those created in accelerated
                  memory).
                  The flush method may be called at any time to proactively release
                  the resources used by a VolatileImage so that it does not prevent
                  subsequent VolatileImage objects from being accelerated.
                  In this way, applications can have more control over the state
                  of the resources taken up by obsolete VolatileImage objects.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  This image should not be subclassed directly but should be created
                  by using the {@link java.awt.Component#createVolatileImage(int,int)Component.createVolatileImage} or{@link java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration#createCompatibleVolatileImage(int,int)GraphicsConfiguration.createCompatibleVolatileImage(int, int)} methods.
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  An example of using a VolatileImage object follows:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  // image creation
                  VolatileImage vImg = createVolatileImage(w, h);
                  // rendering to the image
                  void renderOffscreen() {
                  do {
                  if (vImg.validate(getGraphicsConfiguration()) ==
                  VolatileImage.IMAGE_INCOMPATIBLE)
                  {
                  // old vImg doesn&apos;t work with new GraphicsConfig; re-create it
                  vImg = createVolatileImage(w, h);
                  }
                  Graphics2D g = vImg.createGraphics();
                  //
                  // miscellaneous rendering commands...
                  //
                  g.dispose();
                  } while (vImg.contentsLost());
                  }
                  // copying from the image (here, gScreen is the Graphics
                  // object for the onscreen window)
                  do {
                  int returnCode = vImg.validate(getGraphicsConfiguration());
                  if (returnCode == VolatileImage.IMAGE_RESTORED) {
                  // Contents need to be restored
                  renderOffscreen();      // restore contents
                  } else if (returnCode == VolatileImage.IMAGE_INCOMPATIBLE) {
                  // old vImg doesn&apos;t work with new GraphicsConfig; re-create it
                  vImg = createVolatileImage(w, h);
                  renderOffscreen();
                  }
                  gScreen.drawImage(vImg, 0, 0, this);
                  } while (vImg.contentsLost());
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  Note that this class subclasses from the {@link Image} class, which
                  includes methods that take an {@link ImageObserver} parameter for
                  asynchronous notifications as information is received from
                  a potential {@link ImageProducer}.  Since this &lt;code&gt;VolatileImage&lt;/code&gt;
                  is not loaded from an asynchronous source, the various methods that take
                  an &lt;code&gt;ImageObserver&lt;/code&gt; parameter will behave as if the data has
                  already been obtained from the &lt;code&gt;ImageProducer&lt;/code&gt;.
                  Specifically, this means that the return values from such methods
                  will never indicate that the information is not yet available and
                  the &lt;code&gt;ImageObserver&lt;/code&gt; used in such methods will never
                  need to be recorded for an asynchronous callback notification.

                This returns an ImageProducer for this VolatileImage.
                  Note that the VolatileImage object is optimized for
                  rendering operations and blitting to the screen or other
                  VolatileImage objects, as opposed to reading back the
                  pixels of the image.  Therefore, operations such as
                  &lt;code&gt;getSource&lt;/code&gt; may not perform as fast as
                  operations that do not rely on reading the pixels.
                  Note also that the pixel values read from the image are current
                  with those in the image only at the time that they are
