                The RenderedImageFactory interface (often abbreviated RIF) is
                  intended to be implemented by classes that wish to act as factories
                  to produce different renderings, for example by executing a series
                  of BufferedImageOps on a set of sources, depending on a specific
                  set of parameters, properties, and rendering hints.

                Creates a RenderedImage representing the results of an imaging
                  operation (or chain of operations) for a given ParameterBlock and
                  RenderingHints.  The RIF may also query any source images
                  referenced by the ParameterBlock for their dimensions,
                  SampleModels, properties, etc., as necessary.
                  &lt;p&gt; The create() method can return null if the
                  RenderedImageFactory is not capable of producing output for the
                  given set of source images and parameters.  For example, if a
                  RenderedImageFactory is only capable of performing a 3x3
                  convolution on single-banded image data, and the source image has
                  multiple bands or the convolution Kernel is 5x5, null should be
                  returned.
                  &lt;p&gt; Hints should be taken into account, but can be ignored.
                  The created RenderedImage may have a property identified
                  by the String HINTS_OBSERVED to indicate which RenderingHints
                  were used to create the image.  In addition any RenderedImages
                  that are obtained via the getSources() method on the created
                  RenderedImage may have such a property.
