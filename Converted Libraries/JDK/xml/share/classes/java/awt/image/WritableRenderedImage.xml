            <javadoc line="39">
                WriteableRenderedImage is a common interface for objects which
                  contain or can produce image data in the form of Rasters and
                  which can be modified and/or written over.  The image
                  data may be stored/produced as a single tile or a regular array
                  of tiles.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  WritableRenderedImage provides notification to other interested
                  objects when a tile is checked out for writing (via the
                  getWritableTile method) and when the last writer of a particular
                  tile relinquishes its access (via a call to releaseWritableTile).
                  Additionally, it allows any caller to determine whether any tiles
                  are currently checked out (via hasTileWriters), and to obtain a
                  list of such tiles (via getWritableTileIndices, in the form of a Vector
                  of Point objects).
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Objects wishing to be notified of changes in tile writability must
                  implement the TileObserver interface, and are added by a
                  call to addTileObserver.  Multiple calls to
                  addTileObserver for the same object will result in multiple
                  notifications.  An existing observer may reduce its notifications
                  by calling removeTileObserver; if the observer had no
                  notifications the operation is a no-op.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  It is necessary for a WritableRenderedImage to ensure that
                  notifications occur only when the first writer acquires a tile and
                  the last writer releases it.
