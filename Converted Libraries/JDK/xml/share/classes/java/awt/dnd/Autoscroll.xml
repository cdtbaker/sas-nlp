                During DnD operations it is possible that a user may wish to drop the
                  subject of the operation on a region of a scrollable GUI control that is
                  not currently visible to the user.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  In such situations it is desirable that the GUI control detect this
                  and institute a scroll operation in order to make obscured region(s)
                  visible to the user. This feature is known as autoscrolling.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  If a GUI control is both an active &lt;code&gt;DropTarget&lt;/code&gt;
                  and is also scrollable, it
                  can receive notifications of autoscrolling gestures by the user from
                  the DnD system by implementing this interface.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  An autoscrolling gesture is initiated by the user by keeping the drag
                  cursor motionless with a border region of the &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt;,
                  referred to as
                  the &quot;autoscrolling region&quot;, for a predefined period of time, this will
                  result in repeated scroll requests to the &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt;
                  until the drag &lt;code&gt;Cursor&lt;/code&gt; resumes its motion.
