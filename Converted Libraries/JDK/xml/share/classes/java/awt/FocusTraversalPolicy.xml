                A FocusTraversalPolicy defines the order in which Components with a
                  particular focus cycle root are traversed. Instances can apply the policy to
                  arbitrary focus cycle roots, allowing themselves to be shared across
                  Containers. They do not need to be reinitialized when the focus cycle roots
                  of a Component hierarchy change.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The core responsibility of a FocusTraversalPolicy is to provide algorithms
                  determining the next and previous Components to focus when traversing
                  forward or backward in a UI. Each FocusTraversalPolicy must also provide
                  algorithms for determining the first, last, and default Components in a
                  traversal cycle. First and last Components are used when normal forward and
                  backward traversal, respectively, wraps. The default Component is the first
                  to receive focus when traversing down into a new focus traversal cycle.
                  A FocusTraversalPolicy can optionally provide an algorithm for determining
                  a Window&apos;s initial Component. The initial Component is the first to receive
                  focus when a Window is first made visible.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  FocusTraversalPolicy takes into account &lt;a
                  href=&quot;doc-files/FocusSpec.html#FocusTraversalPolicyProviders&quot;&gt;focus traversal
                  policy providers&lt;/a&gt;.  When searching for first/last/next/previous Component,
                  if a focus traversal policy provider is encountered, its focus traversal
                  policy is used to perform the search operation.
