                The LightweightPeer interface marks a component as depending upon
                  a native container so window related events can be routed to the
                  component.  Since this only applies to components and their
                  extensions, this interface extends ComponentPeer.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The peer interfaces are intended only for use in porting
                  the AWT. They are not intended for use by application
                  developers, and developers should not implement peers
                  nor invoke any of the peer methods directly on the peer
                  instances.
