                The peer interface for {@link Panel}. This is a subinterface of
                  ContainerPeer and does not declare any additional methods because a Panel
                  is just that, a concrete Container.
                  The peer interfaces are intended only for use in porting
                  the AWT. They are not intended for use by application
                  developers, and developers should not implement peers
                  nor invoke any of the peer methods directly on the peer
                  instances.
