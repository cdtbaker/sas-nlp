                The peer interface for fonts. This is only a marker interface and not
                  used by AWT itself.
                  The peer interfaces are intended only for use in porting
                  the AWT. They are not intended for use by application
                  developers, and developers should not implement peers
                  nor invoke any of the peer methods directly on the peer
                  instances.
