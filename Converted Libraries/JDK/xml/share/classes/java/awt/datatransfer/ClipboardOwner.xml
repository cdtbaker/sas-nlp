                Defines the interface for classes that will provide data to
                  a clipboard. An instance of this interface becomes the owner
                  of the contents of a clipboard (clipboard owner) if it is
                  passed as an argument to{@link java.awt.datatransfer.Clipboard#setContents} method of
                  the clipboard and this method returns successfully.
                  The instance remains the clipboard owner until another application
                  or another object within this application asserts ownership
                  of this clipboard.
