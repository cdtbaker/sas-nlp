                Invoked when the target {@link Clipboard} of the listener
                  has changed its available {@link DataFlavor}s.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Some notifications may be redundant &amp;#151; they are not
                  caused by a change of the set of DataFlavors available
                  on the clipboard.
                  For example, if the clipboard subsystem supposes that
                  the system clipboard&apos;s contents has been changed but it
                  can&apos;t ascertain whether its DataFlavors have been changed
                  because of some exceptional condition when accessing the
                  clipboard, the notification is sent to ensure from omitting
                  a significant notification. Ordinarily, those redundant
                  notifications should be occasional.
