                The listener interface for receiving notification of events
                  dispatched to objects that are instances of Component or
                  MenuComponent or their subclasses.  Unlike the other EventListeners
                  in this package, AWTEventListeners passively observe events
                  being dispatched in the AWT, system-wide.  Most applications
                  should never use this class; applications which might use
                  AWTEventListeners include event recorders for automated testing,
                  and facilities such as the Java Accessibility package.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The class that is interested in monitoring AWT events
                  implements this interface, and the object created with that
                  class is registered with the Toolkit, using the Toolkit&apos;s
                  &lt;code&gt;addAWTEventListener&lt;/code&gt; method.  When an event is
                  dispatched anywhere in the AWT, that object&apos;s
                  &lt;code&gt;eventDispatched&lt;/code&gt; method is invoked.
