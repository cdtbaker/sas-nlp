                The listener interface for receiving &quot;interesting&quot; mouse events
                  (press, release, click, enter, and exit) on a component.
                  (To track mouse moves and mouse drags, use the
                  &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionListener&lt;/code&gt;.)
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  The class that is interested in processing a mouse event
                  either implements this interface (and all the methods it
                  contains) or extends the abstract &lt;code&gt;MouseAdapter&lt;/code&gt; class
                  (overriding only the methods of interest).
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
                  component using the component&apos;s &lt;code&gt;addMouseListener&lt;/code&gt;
                  method. A mouse event is generated when the mouse is pressed, released
                  clicked (pressed and released). A mouse event is also generated when
                  the mouse cursor enters or leaves a component. When a mouse event
                  occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and
                  the &lt;code&gt;MouseEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
