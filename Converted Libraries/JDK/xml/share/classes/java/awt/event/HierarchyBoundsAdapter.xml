                An abstract adapter class for receiving ancestor moved and resized events.
                  The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as a
                  convenience for creating listener objects.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Extend this class and override the method for the event of interest. (If
                  you implement the &lt;code&gt;HierarchyBoundsListener&lt;/code&gt; interface, you have
                  to define both methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for
                  them both, so you only have to define the method for the event you care
                  about.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Create a listener object using your class and then register it with a
                  Component using the Component&apos;s &lt;code&gt;addHierarchyBoundsListener&lt;/code&gt;
                  method. When the hierarchy to which the Component belongs changes by
                  resize or movement of an ancestor, the relevant method in the listener
                  object is invoked, and the &lt;code&gt;HierarchyEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
