                The listener interface for receiving mouse motion events on a component.
                  (For clicks and other mouse events, use the &lt;code&gt;MouseListener&lt;/code&gt;.)
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  The class that is interested in processing a mouse motion event
                  either implements this interface (and all the methods it
                  contains) or extends the abstract &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionAdapter&lt;/code&gt; class
                  (overriding only the methods of interest).
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
                  component using the component&apos;s &lt;code&gt;addMouseMotionListener&lt;/code&gt;
                  method. A mouse motion event is generated when the mouse is moved
                  or dragged. (Many such events will be generated). When a mouse motion event
                  occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and
                  the &lt;code&gt;MouseEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
