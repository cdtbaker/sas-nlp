                The listener interface for receiving &lt;code&gt;WindowEvents&lt;/code&gt;, including
                  &lt;code&gt;WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS&lt;/code&gt; events.
                  The class that is interested in processing a &lt;code&gt;WindowEvent&lt;/code&gt;
                  either implements this interface (and
                  all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract
                  &lt;code&gt;WindowAdapter&lt;/code&gt; class (overriding only the methods of interest).
                  The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
                  &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;
                  using the &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s &lt;code&gt;addWindowFocusListener&lt;/code&gt; method.
                  When the &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s
                  status changes by virtue of it being opened, closed, activated, deactivated,
                  iconified, or deiconified, or by focus being transfered into or out of the
                  &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,
                  and the &lt;code&gt;WindowEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
