                An abstract adapter class for receiving mouse motion events.
                  The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as
                  convenience for creating listener objects.
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  Mouse motion events occur when a mouse is moved or dragged.
                  (Many such events will be generated in a normal program.
                  To track clicks and other mouse events, use the MouseAdapter.)
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  Extend this class to create a &lt;code&gt;MouseEvent&lt;/code&gt; listener
                  and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
                  &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionListener&lt;/code&gt; interface, you have to define all of
                  the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
                  all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
                  a component using the component&apos;s &lt;code&gt;addMouseMotionListener&lt;/code&gt;
                  method. When the mouse is moved or dragged, the relevant method in the
                  listener object is invoked and the &lt;code&gt;MouseEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
