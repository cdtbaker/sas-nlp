                  &lt;p&gt; In the case of stream-oriented sockets, this socket option will
                  usually determine whether the socket can be bound to a socket address
                  when a previous connection involving that socket address is in the
                  &lt;em&gt;TIME_WAIT&lt;/em&gt; state. On implementations where the semantics differ,
                  and the socket option is not required to be enabled in order to bind the
                  socket when a previous connection is in this state, then the

                  &lt;p&gt; For datagram-oriented sockets the socket option is used to allow

                  the action taken when unsent data is queued on the socket and a method
                  to close the socket is invoked. If the value of the socket option is zero

                  &lt;em&gt;linger interval&lt;/em&gt;. The linger interval is the timeout for the{@code close} method to block while the operating system attempts to
                  transmit the unsent data or it decides that it is unable to transmit the
                  data. If the value of the socket option is less than zero then the option
                  is disabled. In that case the {@code close} method does not wait until

                  is system dependent. Setting the linger interval to a value that is

                  the &lt;em&gt;loopback&lt;/em&gt; of multicast datagrams. The value of the socket
                  option represents if the option is enabled or disabled.
                  &lt;p&gt; The exact semantics of this socket options are system dependent.
                  In particular, it is system dependent whether the loopback applies to
                  multicast datagrams sent from the socket or received by the socket.
                  For {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET6 IPv6} sockets then it is
                  system dependent whether the option also applies to multicast datagrams
                  sent to IPv4 addresses.
                  &lt;p&gt; The initial/default value of this socket option is {@code TRUE}. An
                  implementation allows this socket option to be set after the socket is
                  bound. Whether the socket option can be queried or changed prior to
                  binding the socket is system dependent.

                Disable the Nagle algorithm.
                  &lt;p&gt; The value of this socket option is a {@code Boolean} that represents
                  whether the option is enabled or disabled. The socket option is specific to
                  stream-oriented sockets using the TCP/IP protocol. TCP/IP uses an algorithm
                  known as &lt;em&gt;The Nagle Algorithm&lt;/em&gt; to coalesce short segments and
                  improve network efficiency.
                  &lt;p&gt; The default value of this socket option is {@code FALSE}. The
                  socket option should only be enabled in cases where it is known that the
                  coalescing impacts performance. The socket option may be enabled at any
                  time. In other words, the Nagle Algorithm can be disabled. Once the option
                  is enabled, it is system dependent whether it can be subsequently
                  disabled. If it cannot, then invoking the {@code setOption} method to
                  disable the option has no effect.
