                This class represents a Socket Address with no protocol attachment.
                  As an abstract class, it is meant to be subclassed with a specific,
                  protocol dependent, implementation.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  It provides an immutable object used by sockets for binding, connecting, or
                  as returned values.
