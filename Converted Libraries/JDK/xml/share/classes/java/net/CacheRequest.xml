                Represents channels for storing resources in the
                  ResponseCache. Instances of such a class provide an
                  OutputStream object which is called by protocol handlers to
                  store the resource data into the cache, and also an abort() method
                  which allows a cache store operation to be interrupted and
                  abandoned. If an IOException is encountered while reading the
                  response or writing to the cache, the current cache store operation
                  will be aborted.
