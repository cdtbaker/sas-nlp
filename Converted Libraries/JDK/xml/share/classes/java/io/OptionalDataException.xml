                Exception indicating the failure of an object read operation due to
                  unread primitive data, or the end of data belonging to a serialized
                  object in the stream.  This exception may be thrown in two cases:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;An attempt was made to read an object when the next element in the
                  stream is primitive data.  In this case, the OptionalDataException&apos;s
                  length field is set to the number of bytes of primitive data
                  immediately readable from the stream, and the eof field is set to
                  false.
                  &lt;li&gt;An attempt was made to read past the end of data consumable by a
                  class-defined readObject or readExternal method.  In this case, the
                  OptionalDataException&apos;s eof field is set to true, and the length field
                  is set to 0.
