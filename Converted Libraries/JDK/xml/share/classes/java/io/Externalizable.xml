                Only the identity of the class of an Externalizable instance is
                  written in the serialization stream and it is the responsibility
                  of the class to save and restore the contents of its instances.
                  The writeExternal and readExternal methods of the Externalizable
                  interface are implemented by a class to give the class complete
                  control over the format and contents of the stream for an object
                  and its supertypes. These methods must explicitly
                  coordinate with the supertype to save its state. These methods supersede
                  customized implementations of writeObject and readObject methods.&lt;br&gt;
                  Object Serialization uses the Serializable and Externalizable
                  interfaces.  Object persistence mechanisms can use them as well.  Each
                  object to be stored is tested for the Externalizable interface. If
                  the object supports Externalizable, the writeExternal method is called. If the
                  object does not support Externalizable and does implement
                  Serializable, the object is saved using
                  ObjectOutputStream. &lt;br&gt; When an Externalizable object is
                  reconstructed, an instance is created using the public no-arg
                  constructor, then the readExternal method called.  Serializable
                  objects are restored by reading them from an ObjectInputStream.&lt;br&gt;
                  An Externalizable instance can designate a substitution object via
                  the writeReplace and readResolve methods documented in the Serializable
                  interface.&lt;br&gt;
