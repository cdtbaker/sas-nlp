                Convenience class for writing character files.  The constructors of this
                  class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer
                  size are acceptable.  To specify these values yourself, construct an
                  OutputStreamWriter on a FileOutputStream.
                  &lt;p&gt;Whether or not a file is available or may be created depends upon the
                  underlying platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be
                  opened for writing by only one &lt;tt&gt;FileWriter&lt;/tt&gt; (or other file-writing
                  object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in this class
                  will fail if the file involved is already open.
                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt; is meant for writing streams of characters.
                  For writing streams of raw bytes, consider using a
                  &lt;code&gt;FileOutputStream&lt;/code&gt;.
