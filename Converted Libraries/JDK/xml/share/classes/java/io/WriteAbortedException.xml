                Signals that one of the ObjectStreamExceptions was thrown during a
                  write operation.  Thrown during a read operation when one of the
                  ObjectStreamExceptions was thrown during a write operation.  The
                  exception that terminated the write can be found in the detail
                  field. The stream is reset to it&apos;s initial state and all references
                  to objects already deserialized are discarded.
                  &lt;p&gt;As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
                  the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The &quot;exception causing
                  the abort&quot; that is provided at construction time and
                  accessed via the public {@link #detail} field is now known as the
                  &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt;, and may be accessed via the {@link Throwable#getCause()}method, as well as the aforementioned &quot;legacy field.&quot;
