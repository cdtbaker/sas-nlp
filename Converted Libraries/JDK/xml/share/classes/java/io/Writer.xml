                Abstract class for writing to character streams.  The only methods that a
                  subclass must implement are write(char[], int, int), flush(), and close().
                  Most subclasses, however, will override some of the methods defined here in
                  order to provide higher efficiency, additional functionality, or both.

                Flushes the stream.  If the stream has saved any characters from the
                  various write() methods in a buffer, write them immediately to their
                  intended destination.  Then, if that destination is another character or
                  byte stream, flush it.  Thus one flush() invocation will flush all the
                  buffers in a chain of Writers and OutputStreams.
                  &lt;p&gt; If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided
                  by the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing the
                  stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are
                  passed to the operating system for writing; it does not guarantee that
                  they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive.

                  further write() or flush() invocations will cause an IOException to be
