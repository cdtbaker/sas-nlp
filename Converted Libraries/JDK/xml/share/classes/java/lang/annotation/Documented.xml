            Indicates that annotations with a type are to be documented by javadoc
              and similar tools by default.  This type should be used to annotate the
              declarations of types whose annotations affect the use of annotated
              elements by their clients.  If a type declaration is annotated with
              Documented, its annotations become part of the public API
              of the annotated elements.
