            Indicates how long annotations with the annotated type are to
              be retained.  If no Retention annotation is present on
              an annotation type declaration, the retention policy defaults to{@code RetentionPolicy.CLASS}.
              &lt;p&gt;A Retention meta-annotation has effect only if the
              meta-annotated type is used directly for annotation.  It has no
              effect if the meta-annotated type is used as a member type in
              another annotation type.
