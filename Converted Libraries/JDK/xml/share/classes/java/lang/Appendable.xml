                An object to which &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; sequences and values can be appended.  The
                  &lt;tt&gt;Appendable&lt;/tt&gt; interface must be implemented by any class whose
                  instances are intended to receive formatted output from a {@link java.util.Formatter}.
                  &lt;p&gt; The characters to be appended should be valid Unicode characters as
                  described in &lt;a href=&quot;Character.html#unicode&quot;&gt;Unicode Character
                  Representation&lt;/a&gt;.  Note that supplementary characters may be composed of
                  multiple 16-bit &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; values.
                  &lt;p&gt; Appendables are not necessarily safe for multithreaded access.  Thread
                  safety is the responsibility of classes that extend and implement this
                  interface.
                  &lt;p&gt; Since this interface may be implemented by existing classes
                  with different styles of error handling there is no guarantee that
                  errors will be propagated to the invoker.
