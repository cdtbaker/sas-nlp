                Thrown when an application attempts to use {@code null} in a
                  case where an object is required. These include:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Calling the instance method of a {@code null} object.
                  &lt;li&gt;Accessing or modifying the field of a {@code null} object.
                  &lt;li&gt;Taking the length of {@code null} as if it were an array.
                  &lt;li&gt;Accessing or modifying the slots of {@code null} as if it
                  were an array.
                  &lt;li&gt;Throwing {@code null} as if it were a {@code Throwable}value.
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Applications should throw instances of this class to indicate
                  other illegal uses of the {@code null} object.{@code NullPointerException} objects may be constructed by the
                  virtual machine as if {@linkplain Throwable#Throwable(String,Throwable,boolean,boolean) suppression were disabled and/or the
                  stack trace was not writable}.
