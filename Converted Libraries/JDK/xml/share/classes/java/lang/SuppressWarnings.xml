            Indicates that the named compiler warnings should be suppressed in the
              annotated element (and in all program elements contained in the annotated
              element).  Note that the set of warnings suppressed in a given element is
              a superset of the warnings suppressed in all containing elements.  For
              example, if you annotate a class to suppress one warning and annotate a
              method to suppress another, both warnings will be suppressed in the method.
              &lt;p&gt;As a matter of style, programmers should always use this annotation
              on the most deeply nested element where it is effective.  If you want to
              suppress a warning in a particular method, you should annotate that
              method rather than its class.

            The set of warnings that are to be suppressed by the compiler in the
              annotated element.  Duplicate names are permitted.  The second and
              successive occurrences of a name are ignored.  The presence of
              unrecognized warning names is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an error: Compilers must
              ignore any warning names they do not recognize.  They are, however,
              free to emit a warning if an annotation contains an unrecognized
              warning name.
              &lt;p&gt;Compiler vendors should document the warning names they support in
              conjunction with this annotation type. They are encouraged to cooperate
              to ensure that the same names work across multiple compilers.
