            A programmer assertion that the body of the annotated method or
              constructor does not perform potentially unsafe operations on its
              varargs parameter.  Applying this annotation to a method or
              constructor suppresses unchecked warnings about a
              &lt;i&gt;non-reifiable&lt;/i&gt; variable arity (vararg) type and suppresses
              unchecked warnings about parameterized array creation at call
              sites.
              &lt;p&gt; In addition to the usage restrictions imposed by its {@link Target @Target} meta-annotation, compilers are required to implement
              additional usage restrictions on this annotation type; it is a
              compile-time error if a method or constructor declaration is
              annotated with a {@code @SafeVarargs} annotation, and either:
              &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;  the declaration is a fixed arity method or constructor
              &lt;li&gt; the declaration is a variable arity method that is neither{@code static} nor {@code final}.
              &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;p&gt; Compilers are encouraged to issue warnings when this annotation
              type is applied to a method or constructor declaration where:
              &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt; The variable arity parameter has a reifiable element type,
              which includes primitive types, {@code Object}, and {@code String}.
              (The unchecked warnings this annotation type suppresses already do
              not occur for a reifiable element type.)
              &lt;li&gt; The body of the method or constructor declaration performs
              potentially unsafe operations, such as an assignment to an element
              of the variable arity parameter&apos;s array that generates an unchecked
              warning.  Some unsafe operations do not trigger an unchecked
              warning.  For example, the aliasing in
              &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
              &amp;#64;SafeVarargs // Not actually safe!
              static void m(List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;... stringLists) {
              Object[] array = stringLists;
              List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; tmpList = Arrays.asList(42);
              array[0] = tmpList; // Semantically invalid, but compiles without warnings
              String s = stringLists[0].get(0); // Oh no, ClassCastException at runtime!
              }
              &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              leads to a {@code ClassCastException} at runtime.
              &lt;p&gt;Future versions of the platform may mandate compiler errors for
              such unsafe operations.
              &lt;/ul&gt;
