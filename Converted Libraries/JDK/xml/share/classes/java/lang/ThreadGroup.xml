                The locking strategy for this code is to try to lock only one level of the
                 tree wherever possible, but otherwise to lock from the bottom up.
                 That is, from child thread groups to parents.
                 This has the advantage of limiting the number of locks that need to be held
                 and in particular avoids having to grab the lock for the root thread group,
                 (or a global lock) which would be a source of contention on a
                 multi-processor system with many thread groups.
                 This policy often leads to taking a snapshot of the state of a thread group
                 and working off of that snapshot, rather than holding the thread group locked
                 while we work on the children.

                A thread group represents a set of threads. In addition, a thread
                  group can also include other thread groups. The thread groups form
                  a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group
                  has a parent.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread
                  group, but not to access information about its thread group&apos;s
                  parent thread group or any other thread groups.

                Called by the Java Virtual Machine when a thread in this
                  thread group stops because of an uncaught exception, and the thread
                  does not have a specific {@link Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler}installed.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The &lt;code&gt;uncaughtException&lt;/code&gt; method of
                  &lt;code&gt;ThreadGroup&lt;/code&gt; does the following:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;If this thread group has a parent thread group, the
                  &lt;code&gt;uncaughtException&lt;/code&gt; method of that parent is called
                  with the same two arguments.
                  &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, this method checks to see if there is a{@linkplain Thread#getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler default
                  uncaught exception handler} installed, and if so, its
                  &lt;code&gt;uncaughtException&lt;/code&gt; method is called with the same
                  two arguments.
                  &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, this method determines if the &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt;
                  argument is an instance of {@link ThreadDeath}. If so, nothing
                  special is done. Otherwise, a message containing the
                  thread&apos;s name, as returned from the thread&apos;s {@link Thread#getName getName} method, and a stack backtrace,
                  using the &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s {@link Throwable#printStackTrace printStackTrace} method, is
                  printed to the {@linkplain System#err standard error stream}.
