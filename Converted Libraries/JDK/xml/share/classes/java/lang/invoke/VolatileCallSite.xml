                A {@code VolatileCallSite} is a {@link CallSite} whose target acts like a volatile variable.
                  An {@code invokedynamic} instruction linked to a {@code VolatileCallSite} sees updates
                  to its call site target immediately, even if the update occurs in another thread.
                  There may be a performance penalty for such tight coupling between threads.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Unlike {@code MutableCallSite}, there is no{@linkplain MutableCallSite#syncAll syncAll operation} on volatile
                  call sites, since every write to a volatile variable is implicitly
                  synchronized with reader threads.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  In other respects, a {@code VolatileCallSite} is interchangeable
                  with {@code MutableCallSite}.
