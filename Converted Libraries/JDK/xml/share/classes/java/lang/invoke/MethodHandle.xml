                A method handle is a typed, directly executable reference to an underlying method,
                  constructor, field, or similar low-level operation, with optional
                  transformations of arguments or return values.
                  These transformations are quite general, and include such patterns as{@linkplain #asType conversion},{@linkplain #bindTo insertion},{@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#dropArguments deletion},
                  and {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#filterArguments substitution}.
                  &lt;h3&gt;Method handle contents&lt;/h3&gt;
                  Method handles are dynamically and strongly typed according to their parameter and return types.
                  They are not distinguished by the name or the defining class of their underlying methods.
                  A method handle must be invoked using a symbolic type descriptor which matches
                  the method handle&apos;s own {@linkplain #type type descriptor}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Every method handle reports its type descriptor via the {@link #type type} accessor.
                  This type descriptor is a {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodType MethodType} object,
                  whose structure is a series of classes, one of which is
                  the return type of the method (or {@code void.class} if none).
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A method handle&apos;s type controls the types of invocations it accepts,
                  and the kinds of transformations that apply to it.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A method handle contains a pair of special invoker methods
                  called {@link #invokeExact invokeExact} and {@link #invoke invoke}.
                  Both invoker methods provide direct access to the method handle&apos;s
                  underlying method, constructor, field, or other operation,
                  as modified by transformations of arguments and return values.
                  Both invokers accept calls which exactly match the method handle&apos;s own type.
                  The plain, inexact invoker also accepts a range of other call types.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
                  Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
                  With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
                  as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables.  This means that any method
                  handle made visible to the application will always be fully formed.
                  This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared
                  variable in a data race.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Method handles cannot be subclassed by the user.
                  Implementations may (or may not) create internal subclasses of {@code MethodHandle}which may be visible via the {@link java.lang.Object#getClass Object.getClass}operation.  The programmer should not draw conclusions about a method handle
                  from its specific class, as the method handle class hierarchy (if any)
                  may change from time to time or across implementations from different vendors.
                  &lt;h3&gt;Method handle compilation&lt;/h3&gt;
                  A Java method call expression naming {@code invokeExact} or {@code invoke}can invoke a method handle from Java source code.
                  From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments
                  and their result can be cast to any return type.
                  Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods{@code Object} return types and variable arity {@code Object} arguments,
                  but they have an additional quality called &lt;em&gt;signature polymorphism&lt;/em&gt;
                  which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to {@code invokeExact}and {@code invoke} compile to an {@code invokevirtual} instruction.
                  More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
                  and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
                  Instead, it must push them on the stack according to their own unconverted types.
                  The method handle object itself is pushed on the stack before the arguments.
                  The compiler then calls the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which
                  describes the argument and return types.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
                  the return type.  This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
                  if there is one, or else {@code Object} if the invocation is an expression
                  or else {@code void} if the invocation is a statement.
                  The cast may be to a primitive type (but not {@code void}).
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  As a corner case, an uncasted {@code null} argument is given
                  a symbolic type descriptor of {@code java.lang.Void}.
                  The ambiguity with the type {@code Void} is harmless, since there are no references of type{@code Void} except the null reference.
                  &lt;h3&gt;Method handle invocation&lt;/h3&gt;
                  The first time a {@code invokevirtual} instruction is executed
                  it is linked, by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
                  and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
                  This is true of calls to {@code invokeExact} and {@code invoke}.
                  In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
                  correct syntax and names it contains are resolved.
                  Thus, an {@code invokevirtual} instruction which invokes
                  a method handle will always link, as long
                  as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
                  and the types exist.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  When the {@code invokevirtual} is executed after linking,
                  the receiving method handle&apos;s type is first checked by the JVM
                  to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
                  If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
                  caller is invoking is not present on the individual
                  method handle being invoked.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  In the case of {@code invokeExact}, the type descriptor of the invocation
                  (after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
                  of the receiving method handle.
                  In the case of plain, inexact {@code invoke}, the resolved type descriptor
                  must be a valid argument to the receiver&apos;s {@link #asType asType} method.
                  Thus, plain {@code invoke} is more permissive than {@code invokeExact}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  After type matching, a call to {@code invokeExact} directly
                  and immediately invoke the method handle&apos;s underlying method
                  (or other behavior, as the case may be).
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A call to plain {@code invoke} works the same as a call to{@code invokeExact}, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
                  exactly matches the method handle&apos;s own type.
                  If there is a type mismatch, {@code invoke} attempts
                  to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
                  as if by a call to {@link #asType asType},
                  to obtain an exactly invokable method handle {@code M2}.
                  This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
                  between caller and callee.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  (&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; The adjusted method handle {@code M2} is not directly observable,
                  and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)
                  &lt;h3&gt;Invocation checking&lt;/h3&gt;
                  In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
                  But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a {@link WrongMethodTypeException},
                  either directly (in the case of {@code invokeExact}) or indirectly as if
                  by a failed call to {@code asType} (in the case of {@code invoke}).
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
                  in a statically typed program can show up as
                  a dynamic {@code WrongMethodTypeException}in a program which uses method handles.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Because method types contain &quot;live&quot; {@code Class} objects,
                  method type matching takes into account both types names and class loaders.
                  Thus, even if a method handle {@code M} is created in one
                  class loader {@code L1} and used in another {@code L2},
                  method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller&apos;s symbolic type
                  descriptor, as resolved in {@code L2},
                  is matched against the original callee method&apos;s symbolic type descriptor,
                  as resolved in {@code L1}.
                  The resolution in {@code L1} happens when {@code M} is created
                  and its type is assigned, while the resolution in {@code L2} happens
                  when the {@code invokevirtual} instruction is linked.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Apart from the checking of type descriptors,
                  a method handle&apos;s capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
                  If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
                  that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
                  in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
                  a reflective method is invoked,
                  method handle access checking is performed
                  &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#access&quot;&gt;when the method handle is created&lt;/a&gt;.
                  In the case of {@code ldc} (see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
                  the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
                  should generally be kept secret.
                  They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
                  the untrusted code would be harmless.
                  &lt;h3&gt;Method handle creation&lt;/h3&gt;
                  Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
                  any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
                  This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called{@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup MethodHandles.Lookup}For example, a static method handle can be obtained
                  from {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#findStatic Lookup.findStatic}.
                  There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
                  such as {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#unreflect Lookup.unreflect}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
                  fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
                  in a class file&apos;s constant pool as constants to be loaded by {@code ldc} bytecodes.
                  A new type of constant pool entry, {@code CONSTANT_MethodHandle},
                  refers directly to an associated {@code CONSTANT_Methodref},{@code CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref}, or {@code CONSTANT_Fieldref}constant pool entry.
                  (For more details on method handle constants,
                  see the &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#mhcon&quot;&gt;package summary&lt;/a&gt;.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
                  constructors with the variable arity modifier bit ({@code 0x0080})
                  have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
                  the help of {@link #asVarargsCollector asVarargsCollector}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
                  In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
                  receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
                  In the method handle&apos;s type, the initial receiver argument is typed
                  according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
                  (E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via {@code ldc},
                  the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
                  always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
                  can also be created.  These do not perform virtual lookup based on
                  receiver type.  Such a method handle simulates the effect of
                  an {@code invokespecial} instruction to the same method.
                  &lt;h3&gt;Usage examples&lt;/h3&gt;
                  Here are some examples of usage:
                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
                  Object x, y; String s; int i;
                  MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
                  MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
                  // mt is (char,char)String
                  mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
                  mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, &quot;replace&quot;, mt);
                  s = (String) mh.invokeExact(&quot;daddy&quot;,&apos;d&apos;,&apos;n&apos;);
                  // invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
                  assertEquals(s, &quot;nanny&quot;);
                  // weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
                  s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments(&quot;sappy&quot;, &apos;p&apos;, &apos;v&apos;);
                  assertEquals(s, &quot;savvy&quot;);
                  // mt is (Object[])List
                  mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
                  mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, &quot;asList&quot;, mt);
                  assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
                  x = mh.invoke(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;);
                  // invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
                  assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(&quot;one&quot;,&quot;two&quot;));
                  // mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
                  mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
                  mh = mh.asType(mt);
                  x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
                  // invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
                  assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
                  // mt is ()int
                  mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
                  mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, &quot;size&quot;, mt);
                  i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
                  // invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
                  assert(i == 3);
                  mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
                  mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, &quot;println&quot;, mt);
                  mh.invokeExact(System.out, &quot;Hello, world.&quot;);
                  // invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
                  &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                  Each of the above calls to {@code invokeExact} or plain {@code invoke}generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
                  the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
                  In these examples, the helper method {@code assertEquals} is assumed to
                  be a method which calls {@link Objects.equals java.util.Objects#equals}on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.
                  &lt;h3&gt;Exceptions&lt;/h3&gt;
                  The methods {@code invokeExact} and {@code invoke} are declared
                  to throw {@link java.lang.Throwable Throwable},
                  which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
                  can throw.  Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
                  and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
                  there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
                  checked exceptions to method handle invocations.  But in Java source
                  code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
                  throw {@code Throwable}, or else must catch all
                  throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
                  and wrapping ones which are illegal.
                  &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;sigpoly&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Signature polymorphism&lt;/h3&gt;
                  The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of{@code invokeExact} and plain {@code invoke}is referenced by the term &lt;em&gt;signature polymorphism&lt;/em&gt;.
                  As defined in the Java Language Specification,
                  a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
                  any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
                  compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
                  As usual, the Java compiler emits an {@code invokevirtual}instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
                  The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
                  the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
                  it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
                  (In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
                  dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
                  untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
                  Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
                  untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.
                  &lt;h3&gt;Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API&lt;/h3&gt;
                  Using factory methods in the {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup Lookup} API,
                  any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
                  can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
                  For example, a reflective {@link java.lang.reflect.Method Method} can
                  be converted to a method handle using{@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#unreflect Lookup.unreflect}.
                  The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
                  access to the underlying class members.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  As a special case,
                  when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
                  methods {@code invokeExact} or plain {@code invoke} in this class,
                  they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
                  Their reflective appearance, as viewed by{@link java.lang.Class#getDeclaredMethod Class.getDeclaredMethod},
                  is unaffected by their special status in this API.
                  For example, {@link java.lang.reflect.Method#getModifiers Method.getModifiers}will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
                  declared method, including in this case {@code native} and {@code varargs} bits.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
                  invoked via {@link java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke}.
                  However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
                  Such a call, if passed the required argument
                  (a single one, of type {@code Object[]}), will ignore the argument and
                  will throw an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Since {@code invokevirtual} instructions can natively
                  invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
                  with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
                  Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by{@code Class.getDeclaredMethod}, may be regarded as placeholders only.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
                  use {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#exactInvoker MethodHandles.exactInvoker},
                  or {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#invoker MethodHandles.invoker}.
                  The {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#findVirtual Lookup.findVirtual}API is also able to return a method handle
                  to call {@code invokeExact} or plain {@code invoke},
                  for any specified type descriptor .
                  &lt;h3&gt;Interoperation between method handles and Java generics&lt;/h3&gt;
                  A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
                  which is declared with Java generic types.
                  As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
                  will constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
                  When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
                  or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
                  If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
                  types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
                  for the {@code invokevirtual} instruction.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Method handles do not represent
                  their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
                  because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
                  Java types.
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Method types range over all possible arities,
                  from no arguments to up to 255 of arguments (a limit imposed by the JVM).
                  Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
                  which Java generic types cannot range over.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
                  often generic across a wide range of function types, including
                  those of multiple arities.  It is impossible to represent such
                  genericity with a Java type parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;

                  which mentions only the type {@code Object}, and whose arity is the length
                  of the argument array.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Specifically, execution proceeds as if by the following steps,
                  although the methods are not guaranteed to be called if the JVM
                  can predict their effects.
                  &lt;ul&gt;

                  &lt;li&gt;Determine the general type {@code TN} of {@code N} arguments as
                  as {@code TN=MethodType.genericMethodType(N)}.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Force the original target method handle {@code MH0} to the
                  required type, as {@code MH1 = MH0.asType(TN)}. &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Spread the array into {@code N} separate arguments {@code A0, ...}. &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Invoke the type-adjusted method handle on the unpacked arguments:
                  MH1.invokeExact(A0, ...). &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Take the return value as an {@code Object} reference. &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Because of the action of the {@code asType} step, the following argument
                  conversions are applied as necessary:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;reference casting
                  &lt;li&gt;unboxing

                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The result returned by the call is boxed if it is a primitive,
                  or forced to null if the return type is void.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  This call is equivalent to the following code:
                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
                  MethodHandle invoker = MethodHandles.spreadInvoker(this.type(), 0);

                Produces an adapter method handle which adapts the type of the
                  current method handle to a new type.
                  The resulting method handle is guaranteed to report a type
                  which is equal to the desired new type.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  If the original type and new type are equal, returns {@code this}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The new method handle, when invoked, will perform the following
                  steps:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Convert the incoming argument list to match the original
                  method handle&apos;s argument list.
                  &lt;li&gt;Invoke the original method handle on the converted argument list.
                  &lt;li&gt;Convert any result returned by the original method handle
                  to the return type of new method handle.
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  This method provides the crucial behavioral difference between{@link #invokeExact invokeExact} and plain, inexact {@link #invoke invoke}.
                  The two methods
                  perform the same steps when the caller&apos;s type descriptor exactly m atches
                  the callee&apos;s, but when the types differ, plain {@link #invoke invoke}also calls {@code asType} (or some internal equivalent) in order
                  to match up the caller&apos;s and callee&apos;s types.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  If the current method is a variable arity method handle
                  argument list conversion may involve the conversion and collection
                  of several arguments into an array, as{@linkplain #asVarargsCollector described elsewhere}.
                  In every other case, all conversions are applied &lt;em&gt;pairwise&lt;/em&gt;,
                  which means that each argument or return value is converted to
                  exactly one argument or return value (or no return value).
                  The applied conversions are defined by consulting the
                  the corresponding component types of the old and new
                  method handle types.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Let &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; be corresponding new and old parameter types,
                  or old and new return types.  Specifically, for some valid index {@code i}, let
                  &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt;{@code =newType.parameterType(i)} and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt;{@code =this.type().parameterType(i)}.
                  Or else, going the other way for return values, let
                  &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt;{@code =this.type().returnType()} and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt;{@code =newType.returnType()}.
                  If the types are the same, the new method handle makes no change
                  to the corresponding argument or return value (if any).
                  Otherwise, one of the following conversions is applied
                  if possible:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;If &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; are references, then a cast to &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; is applied.
                  (The types do not need to be related in any particular way.
                  This is because a dynamic value of null can convert to any reference type.)
                  &lt;li&gt;If &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; are primitives, then a Java method invocation
                  conversion (JLS 5.3) is applied, if one exists.
                  (Specifically, &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; must convert to &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; by a widening primitive conversion.)
                  &lt;li&gt;If &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; is a primitive and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; a reference,
                  a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) is applied if one exists.
                  (Specifically, the value is boxed from &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; to its wrapper class,
                  which is then widened as needed to &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt;.)
                  &lt;li&gt;If &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; is a reference and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; a primitive, an unboxing
                  conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed
                  by a Java method invocation conversion (JLS 5.3)
                  on the primitive value.  (These are the primitive widening conversions.)
                  &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; must be a wrapper class or a supertype of one.
                  (In the case where &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; is Object, these are the conversions
                  allowed by {@link java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke}.)
                  The unboxing conversion must have a possibility of success, which means that
                  if &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; is not itself a wrapper class, there must exist at least one
                  wrapper class &lt;em&gt;TW&lt;/em&gt; which is a subtype of &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; and whose unboxed
                  primitive value can be widened to &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt;.
                  &lt;li&gt;If the return type &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; is marked as void, any returned value is discarded
                  &lt;li&gt;If the return type &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; is void and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; a reference, a null value is introduced.
                  &lt;li&gt;If the return type &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; is void and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; a primitive,
                  a zero value is introduced.
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  (&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Both &lt;em&gt;T0&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T1&lt;/em&gt; may be regarded as static types,
                  because neither corresponds specifically to the &lt;em&gt;dynamic type&lt;/em&gt; of any
                  actual argument or return value.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The method handle conversion cannot be made if any one of the required
                  pairwise conversions cannot be made.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  At runtime, the conversions applied to reference arguments
                  or return values may require additional runtime checks which can fail.
                  An unboxing operation may fail because the original reference is null,
                  causing a {@link java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException}.
                  An unboxing operation or a reference cast may also fail on a reference
                  to an object of the wrong type,
                  causing a {@link java.lang.ClassCastException ClassCastException}.
                  Although an unboxing operation may accept several kinds of wrappers,
                  if none are available, a {@code ClassCastException} will be thrown.

                Makes an &lt;em&gt;array-spreading&lt;/em&gt; method handle, which accepts a trailing array argument
                  and spreads its elements as positional arguments.
                  The new method handle adapts, as its &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt;,
                  the current method handle.  The type of the adapter will be
                  the same as the type of the target, except that the final{@code arrayLength} parameters of the target&apos;s type are replaced
                  by a single array parameter of type {@code arrayType}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  If the array element type differs from any of the corresponding
                  argument types on the original target,
                  the original target is adapted to take the array elements directly,
                  as if by a call to {@link #asType asType}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  When called, the adapter replaces a trailing array argument
                  by the array&apos;s elements, each as its own argument to the target.
                  (The order of the arguments is preserved.)
                  They are converted pairwise by casting and/or unboxing
                  to the types of the trailing parameters of the target.
                  Finally the target is called.
                  What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Before calling the target, the adapter verifies that the array
                  contains exactly enough elements to provide a correct argument count
                  to the target method handle.
                  (The array may also be null when zero elements are required.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Here are some simple examples of array-spreading method handles:
                  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
                  MethodHandle equals = publicLookup()
                  .findVirtual(String.class, &quot;equals&quot;, methodType(boolean.class, Object.class));
                  assert( (boolean) equals.invokeExact(&quot;me&quot;, (Object)&quot;me&quot;));
                  assert(!(boolean) equals.invokeExact(&quot;me&quot;, (Object)&quot;thee&quot;));
                  // spread both arguments from a 2-array:
                  MethodHandle eq2 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 2);
                  assert( (boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ &quot;me&quot;, &quot;me&quot; }));
                  assert(!(boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ &quot;me&quot;, &quot;thee&quot; }));
                  // spread both arguments from a String array:
                  MethodHandle eq2s = equals.asSpreader(String[].class, 2);
                  assert( (boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ &quot;me&quot;, &quot;me&quot; }));
                  assert(!(boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ &quot;me&quot;, &quot;thee&quot; }));
                  // spread second arguments from a 1-array:
                  MethodHandle eq1 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 1);
                  assert( (boolean) eq1.invokeExact(&quot;me&quot;, new Object[]{ &quot;me&quot; }));
                  assert(!(boolean) eq1.invokeExact(&quot;me&quot;, new Object[]{ &quot;thee&quot; }));
                  // spread no arguments from a 0-array or null:
                  MethodHandle eq0 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 0);
                  assert( (boolean) eq0.invokeExact(&quot;me&quot;, (Object)&quot;me&quot;, new Object[0]));
                  assert(!(boolean) eq0.invokeExact(&quot;me&quot;, (Object)&quot;thee&quot;, (Object[])null));
                  // asSpreader and asCollector are approximate inverses:
                  for (int n = 0; n &lt;= 2; n++) {
                  for (Class&lt;?&gt; a : new Class&lt;?&gt;[]{Object[].class, String[].class, CharSequence[].class}) {
                  MethodHandle equals2 = equals.asSpreader(a, n).asCollector(a, n);
                  assert( (boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments(&quot;me&quot;, &quot;me&quot;));
                  assert(!(boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments(&quot;me&quot;, &quot;thee&quot;));
                  }
                  }
                  MethodHandle caToString = publicLookup()

                Makes an &lt;em&gt;array-collecting&lt;/em&gt; method handle, which accepts a given number of trailing
                  positional arguments and collects them into an array argument.
                  The new method handle adapts, as its &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt;,
                  the current method handle.  The type of the adapter will be
                  the same as the type of the target, except that a single trailing
                  parameter (usually of type {@code arrayType}) is replaced by{@code arrayLength} parameters whose type is element type of {@code arrayType}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  If the array type differs from the final argument type on the original target,
                  the original target is adapted to take the array type directly,
                  as if by a call to {@link #asType asType}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  When called, the adapter replaces its trailing {@code arrayLength}arguments by a single new array of type {@code arrayType}, whose elements
                  comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.
                  Finally the target is called.
                  What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  (The array may also be a shared constant when {@code arrayLength} is zero.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  (&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; The {@code arrayType} is often identical to the last
                  parameter type of the original target.
                  It is an explicit argument for symmetry with {@code asSpreader}, and also
                  to allow the target to use a simple {@code Object} as its last parameter type.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  In order to create a collecting adapter which is not restricted to a particular
                  number of collected arguments, use {@link #asVarargsCollector asVarargsCollector} instead.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Here are some examples of array-collecting method handles:
                  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
                  MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
                  .findStatic(Arrays.class, &quot;deepToString&quot;, methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
                  assertEquals(&quot;[won]&quot;,   (String) deepToString.invokeExact(new Object[]{&quot;won&quot;}));
                  MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 1);
                  assertEquals(methodType(String.class, Object.class), ts1.type());
                  //assertEquals(&quot;[won]&quot;, (String) ts1.invokeExact(         new Object[]{&quot;won&quot;})); //FAIL
                  assertEquals(&quot;[[won]]&quot;, (String) ts1.invokeExact((Object) new Object[]{&quot;won&quot;}));
                  // arrayType can be a subtype of Object[]
                  MethodHandle ts2 = deepToString.asCollector(String[].class, 2);
                  assertEquals(methodType(String.class, String.class, String.class), ts2.type());
                  assertEquals(&quot;[two, too]&quot;, (String) ts2.invokeExact(&quot;two&quot;, &quot;too&quot;));
                  MethodHandle ts0 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 0);
                  assertEquals(&quot;[]&quot;, (String) ts0.invokeExact());
                  // collectors can be nested, Lisp-style
                  MethodHandle ts22 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 3).asCollector(String[].class, 2);
                  assertEquals(&quot;[A, B, [C, D]]&quot;, ((String) ts22.invokeExact((Object)&apos;A&apos;, (Object)&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;)));
                  // arrayType can be any primitive array type
                  MethodHandle bytesToString = publicLookup()
                  .findStatic(Arrays.class, &quot;toString&quot;, methodType(String.class, byte[].class))
                  .asCollector(byte[].class, 3);
                  assertEquals(&quot;[1, 2, 3]&quot;, (String) bytesToString.invokeExact((byte)1, (byte)2, (byte)3));
                  MethodHandle longsToString = publicLookup()
                  .findStatic(Arrays.class, &quot;toString&quot;, methodType(String.class, long[].class))
                  .asCollector(long[].class, 1);
                  assertEquals(&quot;[123]&quot;, (String) longsToString.invokeExact((long)123));
                  &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                Makes a &lt;em&gt;variable arity&lt;/em&gt; adapter which is able to accept
                  any number of trailing positional arguments and collect them
                  into an array argument.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The type and behavior of the adapter will be the same as
                  the type and behavior of the target, except that certain{@code invoke} and {@code asType} requests can lead to
                  trailing positional arguments being collected into target&apos;s
                  trailing parameter.
                  Also, the last parameter type of the adapter will be{@code arrayType}, even if the target has a different
                  last parameter type.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  This transformation may return {@code this} if the method handle is
                  already of variable arity and its trailing parameter type
                  is identical to {@code arrayType}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  When called with {@link #invokeExact invokeExact}, the adapter invokes
                  the target with no argument changes.
                  (&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; This behavior is different from a{@linkplain #asCollector fixed arity collector},
                  since it accepts a whole array of indeterminate length,
                  rather than a fixed number of arguments.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  When called with plain, inexact {@link #invoke invoke}, if the caller
                  type is the same as the adapter, the adapter invokes the target as with{@code invokeExact}.
                  (This is the normal behavior for {@code invoke} when types match.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Otherwise, if the caller and adapter arity are the same, and the
                  trailing parameter type of the caller is a reference type identical to
                  or assignable to the trailing parameter type of the adapter,
                  the arguments and return values are converted pairwise,
                  as if by {@link #asType asType} on a fixed arity
                  method handle.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Otherwise, the arities differ, or the adapter&apos;s trailing parameter
                  type is not assignable from the corresponding caller type.
                  In this case, the adapter replaces all trailing arguments from
                  the original trailing argument position onward, by
                  a new array of type {@code arrayType}, whose elements
                  comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The caller type must provides as least enough arguments,
                  and of the correct type, to satisfy the target&apos;s requirement for
                  positional arguments before the trailing array argument.
                  Thus, the caller must supply, at a minimum, {@code N-1} arguments,
                  where {@code N} is the arity of the target.
                  Also, there must exist conversions from the incoming arguments
                  to the target&apos;s arguments.
                  As with other uses of plain {@code invoke}, if these basic
                  requirements are not fulfilled, a {@code WrongMethodTypeException}may be thrown.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  In all cases, what the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  In the final case, it is exactly as if the target method handle were
                  temporarily adapted with a {@linkplain #asCollector fixed arity collector}to the arity required by the caller type.
                  (As with {@code asCollector}, if the array length is zero,
                  a shared constant may be used instead of a new array.
                  If the implied call to {@code asCollector} would throw
                  an {@code IllegalArgumentException} or {@code WrongMethodTypeException},
                  the call to the variable arity adapter must throw{@code WrongMethodTypeException}.)
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The behavior of {@link #asType asType} is also specialized for
                  variable arity adapters, to maintain the invariant that
                  plain, inexact {@code invoke} is always equivalent to an {@code asType}call to adjust the target type, followed by {@code invokeExact}.
                  Therefore, a variable arity adapter responds
                  to an {@code asType} request by building a fixed arity collector,
                  if and only if the adapter and requested type differ either
                  in arity or trailing argument type.
                  The resulting fixed arity collector has its type further adjusted
                  (if necessary) to the requested type by pairwise conversion,
                  as if by another application of {@code asType}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  When a method handle is obtained by executing an {@code ldc} instruction
                  of a {@code CONSTANT_MethodHandle} constant, and the target method is marked
                  as a variable arity method (with the modifier bit {@code 0x0080}),
                  the method handle will accept multiple arities, as if the method handle
                  constant were created by means of a call to {@code asVarargsCollector}.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  In order to create a collecting adapter which collects a predetermined
                  number of arguments, and whose type reflects this predetermined number,
                  use {@link #asCollector asCollector} instead.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  No method handle transformations produce new method handles with
                  variable arity, unless they are documented as doing so.
                  Therefore, besides {@code asVarargsCollector},
                  all methods in {@code MethodHandle} and {@code MethodHandles}will return a method handle with fixed arity,
                  except in the cases where they are specified to return their original
                  operand (e.g., {@code asType} of the method handle&apos;s own type).
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Calling {@code asVarargsCollector} on a method handle which is already
                  of variable arity will produce a method handle with the same type and behavior.
                  It may (or may not) return the original variable arity method handle.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:
                  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
                  MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
                  .findStatic(Arrays.class, &quot;deepToString&quot;, methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
                  MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
                  assertEquals(&quot;[won]&quot;,   (String) ts1.invokeExact(    new Object[]{&quot;won&quot;}));
                  assertEquals(&quot;[won]&quot;,   (String) ts1.invoke(         new Object[]{&quot;won&quot;}));
                  assertEquals(&quot;[won]&quot;,   (String) ts1.invoke(                      &quot;won&quot; ));
                  assertEquals(&quot;[[won]]&quot;, (String) ts1.invoke((Object) new Object[]{&quot;won&quot;}));
                  // findStatic of Arrays.asList(...) produces a variable arity method handle:
                  MethodHandle asList = publicLookup()
                  .findStatic(Arrays.class, &quot;asList&quot;, methodType(List.class, Object[].class));
                  assertEquals(methodType(List.class, Object[].class), asList.type());
                  assert(asList.isVarargsCollector());
                  assertEquals(&quot;[]&quot;, asList.invoke().toString());
                  assertEquals(&quot;[1]&quot;, asList.invoke(1).toString());
                  assertEquals(&quot;[two, too]&quot;, asList.invoke(&quot;two&quot;, &quot;too&quot;).toString());
                  String[] argv = { &quot;three&quot;, &quot;thee&quot;, &quot;tee&quot; };
                  assertEquals(&quot;[three, thee, tee]&quot;, asList.invoke(argv).toString());
                  assertEquals(&quot;[three, thee, tee]&quot;, asList.invoke((Object[])argv).toString());
                  List ls = (List) asList.invoke((Object)argv);
                  assertEquals(1, ls.size());
                  assertEquals(&quot;[three, thee, tee]&quot;, Arrays.toString((Object[])ls.get(0)));
                  &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                  &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
                  &lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt;
                  These rules are designed as a dynamically-typed variation
                  of the Java rules for variable arity methods.
                  In both cases, callers to a variable arity method or method handle
                  can either pass zero or more positional arguments, or else pass
                  pre-collected arrays of any length.  Users should be aware of the
                  special role of the final argument, and of the effect of a
                  type match on that final argument, which determines whether
                  or not a single trailing argument is interpreted as a whole
                  array or a single element of an array to be collected.
