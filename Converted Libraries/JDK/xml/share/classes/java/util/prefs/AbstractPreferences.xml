                This class provides a skeletal implementation of the {@link Preferences}class, greatly easing the task of implementing it.
                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This class is for &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; implementers only.
                  Normal users of the &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; facility should have no need to
                  consult this documentation.  The {@link Preferences} documentation
                  should suffice.&lt;/strong&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Implementors must override the nine abstract service-provider interface
                  (SPI) methods: {@link #getSpi(String)}, {@link #putSpi(String,String)},{@link #removeSpi(String)}, {@link #childSpi(String)}, {@link #removeNodeSpi()}, {@link #keysSpi()}, {@link #childrenNamesSpi()}, {@link #syncSpi()} and {@link #flushSpi()}.  All of the concrete methods specify
                  precisely how they are implemented atop these SPI methods.  The implementor
                  may, at his discretion, override one or more of the concrete methods if the
                  default implementation is unsatisfactory for any reason, such as
                  performance.
                  &lt;p&gt;The SPI methods fall into three groups concerning exception
                  behavior. The &lt;tt&gt;getSpi&lt;/tt&gt; method should never throw exceptions, but it
                  doesn&apos;t really matter, as any exception thrown by this method will be
                  intercepted by {@link #get(String,String)}, which will return the specified
                  default value to the caller.  The &lt;tt&gt;removeNodeSpi, keysSpi,
                  childrenNamesSpi, syncSpi&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;flushSpi&lt;/tt&gt; methods are specified
                  to throw {@link BackingStoreException}, and the implementation is required
                  to throw this checked exception if it is unable to perform the operation.
                  The exception propagates outward, causing the corresponding API method
                  to fail.
                  &lt;p&gt;The remaining SPI methods {@link #putSpi(String,String)}, {@link #removeSpi(String)} and {@link #childSpi(String)} have more complicated
                  exception behavior.  They are not specified to throw
                  &lt;tt&gt;BackingStoreException&lt;/tt&gt;, as they can generally obey their contracts
                  even if the backing store is unavailable.  This is true because they return
                  no information and their effects are not required to become permanent until
                  a subsequent call to {@link Preferences#flush()} or{@link Preferences#sync()}. Generally speaking, these SPI methods should not
                  throw exceptions.  In some implementations, there may be circumstances
                  under which these calls cannot even enqueue the requested operation for
                  later processing.  Even under these circumstances it is generally better to
                  simply ignore the invocation and return, rather than throwing an
                  exception.  Under these circumstances, however, all subsequent invocations
                  of &lt;tt&gt;flush()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;sync&lt;/tt&gt; should return &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;, as
                  returning &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; would imply that all previous operations had
                  successfully been made permanent.
                  &lt;p&gt;There is one circumstance under which &lt;tt&gt;putSpi, removeSpi and
                  childSpi&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; throw an exception: if the caller lacks
                  sufficient privileges on the underlying operating system to perform the
                  requested operation.  This will, for instance, occur on most systems
                  if a non-privileged user attempts to modify system preferences.
                  (The required privileges will vary from implementation to
                  implementation.  On some implementations, they are the right to modify the
                  contents of some directory in the file system; on others they are the right
                  to modify contents of some key in a registry.)  Under any of these
                  circumstances, it would generally be undesirable to let the program
                  continue executing as if these operations would become permanent at a later
                  time.  While implementations are not required to throw an exception under
                  these circumstances, they are encouraged to do so.  A {@link SecurityException} would be appropriate.
                  &lt;p&gt;Most of the SPI methods require the implementation to read or write
                  information at a preferences node.  The implementor should beware of the
                  fact that another VM may have concurrently deleted this node from the
                  backing store.  It is the implementation&apos;s responsibility to recreate the
                  node if it has been deleted.
                  &lt;p&gt;Implementation note: In Sun&apos;s default &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt;
                  implementations, the user&apos;s identity is inherited from the underlying
                  operating system and does not change for the lifetime of the virtual
                  machine.  It is recognized that server-side &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt;
                  implementations may have the user identity change from request to request,
                  implicitly passed to &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; methods via the use of a
                  static {@link ThreadLocal} instance.  Authors of such implementations are
                  &lt;i&gt;strongly&lt;/i&gt; encouraged to determine the user at the time preferences
                  are accessed (for example by the {@link #get(String,String)} or {@link #put(String,String)} method) rather than permanently associating a user
                  with each &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; instance.  The latter behavior conflicts
                  with normal &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; usage and would lead to great confusion.

                  &lt;p&gt;When there are no more tokens, the last value found in the
                  child-cache or returned by &lt;tt&gt;childSpi&lt;/tt&gt; is returned by this
                  method.  If during the traversal, two &lt;tt&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; tokens occur
                  consecutively, or the final token is &lt;tt&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; (rather than a name),
                  an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/tt&gt; is thrown.
                  &lt;p&gt; If the first character of &lt;tt&gt;path&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;&apos;/&apos;&lt;/tt&gt;

                  this method recursively traverses the path starting from the root
                  (rather than starting from this node).  The traversal is otherwise
                  identical to the one described for relative path names.  Dropping
                  the lock on this node prior to commencing the traversal at the root
                  node is essential to avoid the possibility of deadlock, as per the{@link #lock locking invariant}.

                  &lt;p&gt;This implementation checks to see that this node is the root; if so,
                  it throws an appropriate exception.  Then, it locks this node&apos;s parent,

                  checks that it has not already been removed, and then ensures that all
                  of its children are cached: The {@link #childrenNamesSpi()} method is
                  invoked and each returned child name is checked for containment in the
