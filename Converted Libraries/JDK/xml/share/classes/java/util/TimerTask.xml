                  execution and has not yet run, or has not yet been scheduled, it will
                  never run.  If the task has been scheduled for repeated execution, it
                  will never run again.  (If the task is running when this call occurs,
                  the task will run to completion, but will never run again.)
                  &lt;p&gt;Note that calling this method from within the &lt;tt&gt;run&lt;/tt&gt; method of
                  a repeating timer task absolutely guarantees that the timer task will
                  not run again.
                  &lt;p&gt;This method may be called repeatedly; the second and subsequent

                      the task was already cancelled.  (Loosely speaking, this method
                      returns <tt>true</tt> if it prevents one or more scheduled
                      executions from taking place.)

                  &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; execution of this task.  (If this method is invoked
                  while task execution is in progress, the return value is the scheduled
                  execution time of the ongoing task execution.)
                  &lt;p&gt;This method is typically invoked from within a task&apos;s run method, to
                  determine whether the current execution of the task is sufficiently
                  timely to warrant performing the scheduled activity:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  public void run() {
                  if (System.currentTimeMillis() - scheduledExecutionTime() &gt;=
                  MAX_TARDINESS)
                  return;  // Too late; skip this execution.
                  // Perform the task
                  }
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
                  This method is typically &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; used in conjunction with
                  &lt;i&gt;fixed-delay execution&lt;/i&gt; repeating tasks, as their scheduled
                  execution times are allowed to drift over time, and so are not terribly
                  significant.                
                <return>
                    the time at which the most recent execution of this task was

                      The return value is undefined if the task has yet to commence
                      its first execution.
