        <class name="Timer" line="30">
            <javadoc line="30">
                A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a
                  background thread.  Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for
                  repeated execution at regular intervals.
                  &lt;p&gt;Corresponding to each &lt;tt&gt;Timer&lt;/tt&gt; object is a single background
                  thread that is used to execute all of the timer&apos;s tasks, sequentially.
                  Timer tasks should complete quickly.  If a timer task takes excessive time
                  to complete, it &quot;hogs&quot; the timer&apos;s task execution thread.  This can, in
                  turn, delay the execution of subsequent tasks, which may &quot;bunch up&quot; and
                  execute in rapid succession when (and if) the offending task finally
                  completes.
                  &lt;p&gt;After the last live reference to a &lt;tt&gt;Timer&lt;/tt&gt; object goes away
                  &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; all outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer&apos;s task
                  execution thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage
                  collection).  However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur.  By
                  default, the task execution thread does not run as a &lt;i&gt;daemon thread&lt;/i&gt;,
                  so it is capable of keeping an application from terminating.  If a caller
                  wants to terminate a timer&apos;s task execution thread rapidly, the caller
                  should invoke the timer&apos;s &lt;tt&gt;cancel&lt;/tt&gt; method.
                  &lt;p&gt;If the timer&apos;s task execution thread terminates unexpectedly, for
                  example, because its &lt;tt&gt;stop&lt;/tt&gt; method is invoked, any further
                  attempt to schedule a task on the timer will result in an
                  &lt;tt&gt;IllegalStateException&lt;/tt&gt;, as if the timer&apos;s &lt;tt&gt;cancel&lt;/tt&gt;
                  method had been invoked.
                  &lt;p&gt;This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single
                  &lt;tt&gt;Timer&lt;/tt&gt; object without the need for external synchronization.
                  &lt;p&gt;This class does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; offer real-time guarantees: it schedules
                  tasks using the &lt;tt&gt;Object.wait(long)&lt;/tt&gt; method.
                  &lt;p&gt;Java 5.0 introduced the {@code java.util.concurrent} package and
                  one of the concurrency utilities therein is the {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} which is a thread pool for repeatedly
                  executing tasks at a given rate or delay.  It is effectively a more
                  versatile replacement for the {@code Timer}/{@code TimerTask}combination, as it allows multiple service threads, accepts various
                  time units, and doesn&apos;t require subclassing {@code TimerTask} (just
                  implement {@code Runnable}).  Configuring {@codeScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} with one thread makes it equivalent to{@code Timer}.
                  &lt;p&gt;Implementation note: This class scales to large numbers of concurrently
                  scheduled tasks (thousands should present no problem).  Internally,
                  it uses a binary heap to represent its task queue, so the cost to schedule
                  a task is O(log n), where n is the number of concurrently scheduled tasks.
                  &lt;p&gt;Implementation note: All constructors start a timer thread.

                This class represents a timer task queue: a priority queue of TimerTasks,
                  ordered on nextExecutionTime.  Each Timer object has one of these, which it
                  shares with its TimerThread.  Internally this class uses a heap, which
                  offers log(n) performance for the add, removeMin and rescheduleMin
                  operations, and constant time performance for the getMin operation.
