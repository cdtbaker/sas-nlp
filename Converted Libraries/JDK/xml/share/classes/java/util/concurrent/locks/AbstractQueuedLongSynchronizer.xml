                    Wait queue node class.
                      &lt;p&gt;The wait queue is a variant of a &quot;CLH&quot; (Craig, Landin, and
                      Hagersten) lock queue. CLH locks are normally used for
                      spinlocks.  We instead use them for blocking synchronizers, but
                      use the same basic tactic of holding some of the control
                      information about a thread in the predecessor of its node.  A
                      &quot;status&quot; field in each node keeps track of whether a thread
                      should block.  A node is signalled when its predecessor
                      releases.  Each node of the queue otherwise serves as a
                      specific-notification-style monitor holding a single waiting
                      thread. The status field does NOT control whether threads are
                      granted locks etc though.  A thread may try to acquire if it is
                      first in the queue. But being first does not guarantee success;
                      it only gives the right to contend.  So the currently released
                      contender thread may need to rewait.
                      &lt;p&gt;To enqueue into a CLH lock, you atomically splice it in as new
                      tail. To dequeue, you just set the head field.
                      &lt;pre&gt;
                      +------+  prev +-----+       +-----+
                      head |      | &lt;---- |     | &lt;---- |     |  tail
                      +------+       +-----+       +-----+
                      &lt;/pre&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;Insertion into a CLH queue requires only a single atomic
                      operation on &quot;tail&quot;, so there is a simple atomic point of
                      demarcation from unqueued to queued. Similarly, dequeing
                      involves only updating the &quot;head&quot;. However, it takes a bit
                      more work for nodes to determine who their successors are,
                      in part to deal with possible cancellation due to timeouts
                      and interrupts.
                      &lt;p&gt;The &quot;prev&quot; links (not used in original CLH locks), are mainly
                      needed to handle cancellation. If a node is cancelled, its
                      successor is (normally) relinked to a non-cancelled
                      predecessor. For explanation of similar mechanics in the case
                      of spin locks, see the papers by Scott and Scherer at
                      http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/
                      &lt;p&gt;We also use &quot;next&quot; links to implement blocking mechanics.
                      The thread id for each node is kept in its own node, so a
                      predecessor signals the next node to wake up by traversing
                      next link to determine which thread it is.  Determination of
                      successor must avoid races with newly queued nodes to set
                      the &quot;next&quot; fields of their predecessors.  This is solved
                      when necessary by checking backwards from the atomically
                      updated &quot;tail&quot; when a node&apos;s successor appears to be null.
                      (Or, said differently, the next-links are an optimization
                      so that we don&apos;t usually need a backward scan.)
                      &lt;p&gt;Cancellation introduces some conservatism to the basic
                      algorithms.  Since we must poll for cancellation of other
                      nodes, we can miss noticing whether a cancelled node is
                      ahead or behind us. This is dealt with by always unparking
                      successors upon cancellation, allowing them to stabilize on
                      a new predecessor, unless we can identify an uncancelled
                      predecessor who will carry this responsibility.
                      &lt;p&gt;CLH queues need a dummy header node to get started. But
                      we don&apos;t create them on construction, because it would be wasted
                      effort if there is never contention. Instead, the node
                      is constructed and head and tail pointers are set upon first
                      contention.
                      &lt;p&gt;Threads waiting on Conditions use the same nodes, but
                      use an additional link. Conditions only need to link nodes
                      in simple (non-concurrent) linked queues because they are
                      only accessed when exclusively held.  Upon await, a node is
                      inserted into a condition queue.  Upon signal, the node is
                      transferred to the main queue.  A special value of status
                      field is used to mark which queue a node is on.

                      SIGNAL:     The successor of this node is (or will soon be)
                      blocked (via park), so the current node must
                      unpark its successor when it releases or
                      cancels. To avoid races, acquire methods must
                      first indicate they need a signal,
                      then retry the atomic acquire, and then,
                      on failure, block.
                      CANCELLED:  This node is cancelled due to timeout or interrupt.
                      Nodes never leave this state. In particular,
                      a thread with cancelled node never again blocks.
                      CONDITION:  This node is currently on a condition queue.
                      It will not be used as a sync queue node
                      until transferred, at which time the status
                      will be set to 0. (Use of this value here has
                      nothing to do with the other uses of the
                      field, but simplifies mechanics.)
                      PROPAGATE:  A releaseShared should be propagated to other
                      nodes. This is set (for head node only) in
                      doReleaseShared to ensure propagation
                      continues, even if other operations have
                      since intervened.
                      0:          None of the above
                      The values are arranged numerically to simplify use.
                      Non-negative values mean that a node doesn&apos;t need to
                      signal. So, most code doesn&apos;t need to check for particular
                      values, just for sign.
                      The field is initialized to 0 for normal sync nodes, and
                      CONDITION for condition nodes.  It is modified using CAS
                      (or when possible, unconditional volatile writes).

                      because the head node is never cancelled: A node becomes

                    Unlinks cancelled waiter nodes from condition queue.
                      Called only while holding lock. This is called when
                      cancellation occurred during condition wait, and upon
                      insertion of a new waiter when lastWaiter is seen to have
                      been cancelled. This method is needed to avoid garbage
                      retention in the absence of signals. So even though it may
                      require a full traversal, it comes into play only when
                      timeouts or cancellations occur in the absence of
                      signals. It traverses all nodes rather than stopping at a
                      particular target to unlink all pointers to garbage nodes
                      without requiring many re-traversals during cancellation

                Setup to support compareAndSet. We need to natively implement
                  this here: For the sake of permitting future enhancements, we
                  cannot explicitly subclass AtomicLong, which would be
                  efficient and useful otherwise. So, as the lesser of evils, we
                  natively implement using hotspot intrinsics API. And while we
                  are at it, we do the same for other CASable fields (which could
                  otherwise be done with atomic field updaters).
