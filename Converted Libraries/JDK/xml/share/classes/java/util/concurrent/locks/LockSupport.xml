                Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other
                  synchronization classes.
                  &lt;p&gt;This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit
                  (in the sense of the {@link java.util.concurrent.SemaphoreSemaphore} class). A call to {@code park} will return immediately
                  if the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise
                  it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; block.  A call to {@code unpark} makes the permit
                  available, if it was not already available. (Unlike with Semaphores
                  though, permits do not accumulate. There is at most one.)
                  &lt;p&gt;Methods {@code park} and {@code unpark} provide efficient
                  means of blocking and unblocking threads that do not encounter the
                  problems that cause the deprecated methods {@code Thread.suspend}and {@code Thread.resume} to be unusable for such purposes: Races
                  between one thread invoking {@code park} and another thread trying
                  to {@code unpark} it will preserve liveness, due to the
                  permit. Additionally, {@code park} will return if the caller&apos;s
                  thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are supported. The{@code park} method may also return at any other time, for &quot;no
                  reason&quot;, so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks
                  conditions upon return. In this sense {@code park} serves as an
                  optimization of a &quot;busy wait&quot; that does not waste as much time
                  spinning, but must be paired with an {@code unpark} to be
                  effective.
                  &lt;p&gt;The three forms of {@code park} each also support a{@code blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while
                  the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to
                  identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may
                  access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker}.) The use of these
                  forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is
                  strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a{@code blocker} within a lock implementation is {@code this}.
                  &lt;p&gt;These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating
                  higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves
                  useful for most concurrency control applications.  The {@code park}method is designed for use only in constructions of the form:
                  &lt;pre&gt;while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }&lt;/pre&gt;
                  where neither {@code canProceed} nor any other actions prior to the
                  call to {@code park} entail locking or blocking.  Because only one
                  permit is associated with each thread, any intermediary uses of{@code park} could interfere with its intended effects.
                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Usage.&lt;/b&gt; Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out
                  non-reentrant lock class:
                  &lt;pre&gt;{@code}class FIFOMutex 
                  private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false);
                  private final Queue&lt;Thread&gt; waiters
                  = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Thread&gt;();
                  public void lock() {
                  boolean wasInterrupted = false;
                  Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
                  waiters.add(current);
                  // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock
                  while (waiters.peek() != current ||
                  !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
                  LockSupport.park(this);
                  if (Thread.interrupted()) // ignore interrupts while waiting
                  wasInterrupted = true;
                  }
                  waiters.remove();
                  if (wasInterrupted)          // reassert interrupt status on exit
                  current.interrupt();
                  }
                  public void unlock() {
                  locked.set(false);
                  LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek());
                  }
                  }}&lt;/pre&gt;

                Disables the current thread for thread scheduling purposes, until

                  &lt;p&gt;If the permit is available then it is consumed and the call
                  returns immediately; otherwise the current thread becomes disabled

                  &lt;li&gt;The specified deadline passes; or
                  &lt;li&gt;The call spuriously (that is, for no reason) returns.
