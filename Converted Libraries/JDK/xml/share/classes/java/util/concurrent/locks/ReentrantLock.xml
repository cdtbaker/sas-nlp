            <javadoc line="41">
                A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} with the same basic
                  behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using{@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended
                  capabilities.
                  &lt;p&gt;A {@code ReentrantLock} is &lt;em&gt;owned&lt;/em&gt; by the thread last
                  successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking{@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
                  the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
                  immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
                  be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link #getHoldCount}.
                  &lt;p&gt;The constructor for this class accepts an optional
                  &lt;em&gt;fairness&lt;/em&gt; parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
                  contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
                  thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
                  access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
                  may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
                  slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
                  variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
                  starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
                  fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
                  fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
                  active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
                  lock.
                  Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock() tryLock} method does not
                  honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
                  is available even if other threads are waiting.
                  &lt;p&gt;It is recommended practice to &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; immediately
                  follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
                  typically in a before/after construction such as:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  class X {
                  private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
                  // ...
                  public void m() {
                  lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
                  try {
                  // ... method body
                  } finally {
                  lock.unlock()
                  }
                  }
                  }
                  &lt;/pre&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
                  class defines methods {@code isLocked} and{@code getLockQueueLength}, as well as some associated{@code protected} access methods that may be useful for
                  instrumentation and monitoring.
                  &lt;p&gt;Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
                  locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
                  its state when serialized.
                  &lt;p&gt;This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
                  the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in{@link Error} throws from locking methods.

                  immediately with the value {@code true}, setting the lock hold count
                  to one. If this lock has been set to use a fair ordering policy then
                  an available lock &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; be acquired if any other threads
                  are waiting for the lock. This is in contrast to the {@link #tryLock()}method. If you want a timed {@code tryLock} that does permit barging on
                  a fair lock then combine the timed and un-timed forms together:
                  &lt;pre&gt;if (lock.tryLock() || lock.tryLock(timeout, unit) ) { ... }

                  current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
                  purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;The lock is acquired by the current thread; or

                  &lt;li&gt;The specified waiting time elapses
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;If the lock is acquired then the value {@code true} is returned and
                  the lock hold count is set to one.
                  &lt;p&gt;If the current thread:

                  will not wait at all.
                  &lt;p&gt;In this implementation, as this method is an explicit
                  interruption point, preference is given to responding to the
                  interrupt over normal or reentrant acquisition of the lock, and

                Queries if this lock is held by the current thread.
                  &lt;p&gt;Analogous to the {@link Thread#holdsLock} method for built-in
                  monitor locks, this method is typically used for debugging and
                  testing. For example, a method that should only be called while
                  a lock is held can assert that this is the case:
                  &lt;pre&gt;
                  class X {
                  ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

                  public void m() {
                  assert lock.isHeldByCurrentThread();

                  &lt;p&gt;It can also be used to ensure that a reentrant lock is used

                  &lt;pre&gt;

                Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the
