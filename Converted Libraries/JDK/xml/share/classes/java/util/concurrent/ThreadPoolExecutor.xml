                An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
                  one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
                  using {@link Executors} factory methods.
                  &lt;p&gt;Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
                  provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
                  asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
                  and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
                  including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
                  Each {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} also maintains some basic
                  statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
                  &lt;p&gt;To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
                  provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
                  hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient{@link Executors} factory methods {@link Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
                  automatic thread reclamation), {@link Executors#newFixedThreadPool}(fixed size thread pool) and {@link Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
                  preconfigure settings for the most common usage
                  scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
                  configuring and tuning this class:
                  &lt;dl&gt;
                  &lt;dt&gt;Core and maximum pool sizes&lt;/dt&gt;
                  &lt;dd&gt;A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} will automatically adjust the
                  pool size (see {@link #getPoolSize})
                  according to the bounds set by
                  corePoolSize (see {@link #getCorePoolSize}) and
                  maximumPoolSize (see {@link #getMaximumPoolSize}).
                  When a new task is submitted in method {@link #execute}, and fewer
                  than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is created to
                  handle the request, even if other worker threads are idle.  If
                  there are more than corePoolSize but less than maximumPoolSize
                  threads running, a new thread will be created only if the queue is
                  full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize the same, you
                  create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting maximumPoolSize to an
                  essentially unbounded value such as {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you
                  allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary number of concurrent
                  tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool sizes are set only
                  upon construction, but they may also be changed dynamically using{@link #setCorePoolSize} and {@link #setMaximumPoolSize}. &lt;/dd&gt;
                  &lt;dt&gt;On-demand construction&lt;/dt&gt;
                  &lt;dd&gt; By default, even core threads are initially created and
                  started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
                  dynamically using method {@link #prestartCoreThread} or {@link #prestartAllCoreThreads}.  You probably want to prestart threads if
                  you construct the pool with a non-empty queue. &lt;/dd&gt;
                  &lt;dt&gt;Creating new threads&lt;/dt&gt;
                  &lt;dd&gt;New threads are created using a {@link ThreadFactory}.  If not
                  otherwise specified, a {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory} is
                  used, that creates threads to all be in the same {@link ThreadGroup} and with the same {@code NORM_PRIORITY} priority and
                  non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
                  alter the thread&apos;s name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
                  etc. If a {@code ThreadFactory} fails to create a thread when asked
                  by returning null from {@code newThread}, the executor will
                  continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
                  should possess the &quot;modifyThread&quot; {@code RuntimePermission}. If
                  worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
                  permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
                  take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
                  state in which termination is possible but not completed.&lt;/dd&gt;
                  &lt;dt&gt;Keep-alive times&lt;/dt&gt;
                  &lt;dd&gt;If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
                  excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
                  than the keepAliveTime (see {@link #getKeepAliveTime}). This
                  provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the pool is
                  not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active later, new
                  threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be changed
                  dynamically using method {@link #setKeepAliveTime}. Using a value
                  of {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively
                  disables idle threads from ever terminating prior to shut down. By
                  default, the keep-alive policy applies only when there are more
                  than corePoolSizeThreads. But method {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)} can be used to apply this
                  time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
                  keepAliveTime value is non-zero. &lt;/dd&gt;
                  &lt;dt&gt;Queuing&lt;/dt&gt;
                  &lt;dd&gt;Any {@link BlockingQueue} may be used to transfer and hold
                  submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
                  always prefers adding a new thread
                  rather than queuing.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
                  always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
                  thread.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
                  this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
                  rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  There are three general strategies for queuing:
                  &lt;ol&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt; Direct handoffs.&lt;/em&gt; A good default choice for a work
                  queue is a {@link SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads
                  without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
                  will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
                  new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
                  handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
                  Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
                  avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
                  possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
                  arrive on average faster than they can be processed.  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt; Unbounded queues.&lt;/em&gt; Using an unbounded queue (for
                  example a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined
                  capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
                  corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
                  threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
                  therefore doesn&apos;t have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
                  each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
                  affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
                  While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
                  transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
                  unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
                  average faster than they can be processed.  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bounded queues.&lt;/em&gt; A bounded queue (for example, an{@link ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
                  used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
                  tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
                  off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
                  CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
                  lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
                  example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
                  time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
                  generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
                  may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
                  decreases throughput.  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ol&gt;
                  &lt;/dd&gt;
                  &lt;dt&gt;Rejected tasks&lt;/dt&gt;
                  &lt;dd&gt; New tasks submitted in method {@link #execute} will be
                  &lt;em&gt;rejected&lt;/em&gt; when the Executor has been shut down, and also
                  when the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and
                  work queue capacity, and is saturated.  In either case, the {@codeexecute} method invokes the {@link RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution} method of its {@link RejectedExecutionHandler}.  Four predefined handler policies are
                  provided:
                  &lt;ol&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; In the default {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}, the
                  handler throws a runtime {@link RejectedExecutionException} upon
                  rejection. &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}, the thread
                  that invokes {@code execute} itself runs the task. This provides a
                  simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
                  new tasks are submitted. &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy}, a task that
                  cannot be executed is simply dropped.  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy}, if the
                  executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
                  is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
                  causing this to be repeated.) &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ol&gt;
                  It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
                  especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
                  capacity or queuing policies. &lt;/dd&gt;
                  &lt;dt&gt;Hook methods&lt;/dt&gt;
                  &lt;dd&gt;This class provides {@code protected} overridable {@link #beforeExecute} and {@link #afterExecute} methods that are called
                  before and after execution of each task.  These can be used to
                  manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
                  ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log
                  entries. Additionally, method {@link #terminated} can be overridden
                  to perform any special processing that needs to be done once the
                  Executor has fully terminated.
                  &lt;p&gt;If hook or callback methods throw exceptions, internal worker
                  threads may in turn fail and abruptly terminate.&lt;/dd&gt;
                  &lt;dt&gt;Queue maintenance&lt;/dt&gt;
                  &lt;dd&gt; Method {@link #getQueue} allows access to the work queue for
                  purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of this method for any
                  other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two supplied methods,{@link #remove} and {@link #purge} are available to assist in
                  storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks become
                  cancelled.&lt;/dd&gt;
                  &lt;dt&gt;Finalization&lt;/dt&gt;
                  &lt;dd&gt; A pool that is no longer referenced in a program &lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt;
                  has no remaining threads will be {@code shutdown} automatically. If
                  you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even
                  if users forget to call {@link #shutdown}, then you must arrange
                  that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate
                  keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
                  setting {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.  &lt;/dd&gt;
                  &lt;/dl&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Extension example&lt;/b&gt;. Most extensions of this class
                  override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
                  here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:
                  &lt;pre&gt; {@code}class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor 
                  private boolean isPaused;
                  private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
                  private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();
                  public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }
                  protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
                  super.beforeExecute(t, r);
                  pauseLock.lock();
                  try {
                  while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
                  } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
                  t.interrupt();
                  } finally {
                  pauseLock.unlock();
                  }
                  }
                  public void pause() {
                  pauseLock.lock();
                  try {
                  isPaused = true;
                  } finally {
                  pauseLock.unlock();
                  }
                  }
                  public void resume() {
                  pauseLock.lock();
                  try {
                  isPaused = false;
                  unpaused.signalAll();
                  } finally {
                  pauseLock.unlock();
                  }
                  }
                  }}&lt;/pre&gt;

                The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
                  two conceptual fields
                  workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
                  runState,    indicating whether running, shutting down etc
                  In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
                  (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
                  billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
                  the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
                  and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
                  arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.
                  The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
                  permitted to start and not permitted to stop.  The value may be
                  transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
                  for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
                  asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
                  bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
                  reported as the current size of the workers set.
                  The runState provides the main lifecyle control, taking on values:
                  RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
                  SHUTDOWN: Don&apos;t accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
                  STOP:     Don&apos;t accept new tasks, don&apos;t process queued tasks,
                  and interrupt in-progress tasks
                  TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
                  the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
                  will run the terminated() hook method
                  TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
                  The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
                  ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
                  time, but need not hit each state. The transitions are:
                  RUNNING -&gt; SHUTDOWN
                  On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize()
                  (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -&gt; STOP
                  On invocation of shutdownNow()
                  SHUTDOWN -&gt; TIDYING
                  When both queue and pool are empty
                  STOP -&gt; TIDYING
                  When pool is empty
                  TIDYING -&gt; TERMINATED
                  When the terminated() hook method has completed
                  Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
                  state reaches TERMINATED.
                  Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
                  straightforward than you&apos;d like because the queue may become
                  empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
                  we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
                  that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see
                  below).

                Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and
                  executes them, while coping with a number of issues:
                  1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
                  don&apos;t need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
                  running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
                  worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
                  parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
                  external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
                  usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
                  2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
                  other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and
                  clearInterruptsForTaskRun called to ensure that unless pool is
                  stopping, this thread does not have its interrupt set.
                  3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
                  might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
                  (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
                  the task.
                  4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
                  gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to
                  afterExecute. We separately handle RuntimeException, Error
                  (both of which the specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary
                  Throwables.  Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within
                  Runnable.run, we wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the
                  thread&apos;s UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
                  conservatively causes thread to die.
                  5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
                  also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
                  die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
                  will be in effect even if task.run throws.
                  The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
                  and the thread&apos;s UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
                  information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
                  user code.
