                A {@link SortedSet} extended with navigation methods reporting
                  closest matches for given search targets. Methods {@code lower},{@code floor}, {@code ceiling}, and {@code higher} return elements
                  respectively less than, less than or equal, greater than or equal,
                  and greater than a given element, returning {@code null} if there
                  is no such element.  A {@code NavigableSet} may be accessed and
                  traversed in either ascending or descending order.  The {@codedescendingSet} method returns a view of the set with the senses of
                  all relational and directional methods inverted. The performance of
                  ascending operations and views is likely to be faster than that of
                  descending ones.  This interface additionally defines methods{@code pollFirst} and {@code pollLast} that return and remove the
                  lowest and highest element, if one exists, else returning {@codenull}.  Methods {@code subSet}, {@code headSet},
                  and {@code tailSet} differ from the like-named {@codeSortedSet} methods in accepting additional arguments describing
                  whether lower and upper bounds are inclusive versus exclusive.
                  Subsets of any {@code NavigableSet} must implement the {@codeNavigableSet} interface.
                  &lt;p&gt; The return values of navigation methods may be ambiguous in
                  implementations that permit {@code null} elements. However, even
                  in this case the result can be disambiguated by checking{@code contains(null)}. To avoid such issues, implementations of
                  this interface are encouraged to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; permit insertion of{@code null} elements. (Note that sorted sets of {@link Comparable} elements intrinsically do not permit {@code null}.)
                  &lt;p&gt;Methods{@link #subSet(Object,Object) subSet(E, E)},{@link #headSet(Object) headSet(E)}, and{@link #tailSet(Object) tailSet(E)}are specified to return {@code SortedSet} to allow existing
                  implementations of {@code SortedSet} to be compatibly retrofitted to
                  implement {@code NavigableSet}, but extensions and implementations
                  of this interface are encouraged to override these methods to return{@code NavigableSet}.

                  all optional set operations that this set supports.
