                A Filter can be used to provide fine grain control over
                  what is logged, beyond the control provided by log levels.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Each Logger and each Handler can have a filter associated with it.
                  The Logger or Handler will call the isLoggable method to check
                  if a given LogRecord should be published.  If isLoggable returns
                  false, the LogRecord will be discarded.
