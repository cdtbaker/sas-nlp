                Abstract class for representing access to a system resource.
                  All permissions have a name (whose interpretation depends on the subclass),
                  as well as abstract functions for defining the semantics of the
                  particular Permission subclass.
                  &lt;p&gt;Most Permission objects also include an &quot;actions&quot; list that tells the actions
                  that are permitted for the object.  For example,
                  for a &lt;code&gt;java.io.FilePermission&lt;/code&gt; object, the permission name is
                  the pathname of a file (or directory), and the actions list
                  (such as &quot;read, write&quot;) specifies which actions are granted for the
                  specified file (or for files in the specified directory).
                  The actions list is optional for Permission objects, such as
                  &lt;code&gt;java.lang.RuntimePermission&lt;/code&gt;,
                  that don&apos;t need such a list; you either have the named permission (such
                  as &quot;system.exit&quot;) or you don&apos;t.
                  &lt;p&gt;An important method that must be implemented by each subclass is
                  the &lt;code&gt;implies&lt;/code&gt; method to compare Permissions. Basically,
                  &quot;permission p1 implies permission p2&quot; means that
                  if one is granted permission p1, one is naturally granted permission p2.
                  Thus, this is not an equality test, but rather more of a
                  subset test.
                  &lt;P&gt; Permission objects are similar to String objects in that they
                  are immutable once they have been created. Subclasses should not
                  provide methods that can change the state of a permission
                  once it has been created.
