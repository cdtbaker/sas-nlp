                This is the interface used for representing one entry in an Access
                  Control List (ACL).&lt;p&gt;
                  An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL entry
                  objects. Each ACL entry object contains a set of permissions associated
                  with a particular principal. (A principal represents an entity such as
                  an individual user or a group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified
                  as being either positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are
                  to be granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions
                  are to be denied. Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry
                  and one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL
                  entries are not allowed for any principal.
                  Note: ACL entries are by default positive. An entry becomes a
                  negative entry only if the{@link #setNegativePermissions() setNegativePermissions}method is called on it.
