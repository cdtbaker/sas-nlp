            The &lt;code&gt;PKIXReason&lt;/code&gt; enumerates the potential PKIX-specific reasons
              that an X.509 certification path may be invalid according to the PKIX
              (RFC 3280) standard. These reasons are in addition to those of the
              &lt;code&gt;CertPathValidatorException.BasicReason&lt;/code&gt; enumeration.
