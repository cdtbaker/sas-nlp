                Under some circumstances a bean may be run on servers where a GUI
                  is not available.  This interface can be used to query a bean to
                  determine whether it absolutely needs a gui, and to advise the
                  bean whether a GUI is available.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  This interface is for expert developers, and is not needed
                  for normal simple beans.  To avoid confusing end-users we
                  avoid using getXXX setXXX design patterns for these methods.
