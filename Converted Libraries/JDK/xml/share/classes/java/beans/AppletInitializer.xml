                  This interface is designed to work in collusion with java.beans.Beans.instantiate.
                  The interafce is intended to provide mechanism to allow the proper
                  initialization of JavaBeans that are also Applets, during their
                  instantiation by java.beans.Beans.instantiate().

                  If passed to the appropriate variant of java.beans.Beans.instantiate
                  this method will be called in order to associate the newly instantiated
                  Applet (JavaBean) with its AppletContext, AppletStub, and Container.

                  &lt;ol&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; Associate the newly instantiated Applet with the appropriate
                  AppletContext.
                  &lt;li&gt; Instantiate an AppletStub() and associate that AppletStub with
                  the Applet via an invocation of setStub().
                  &lt;li&gt; If BeanContext parameter is null, then it shall associate the
                  Applet with its appropriate Container by adding that Applet to its
                  Container via an invocation of add(). If the BeanContext parameter is
                  non-null, then it is the responsibility of the BeanContext to associate
                  the Applet with its Container during the subsequent invocation of its
                  addChildren() method.
