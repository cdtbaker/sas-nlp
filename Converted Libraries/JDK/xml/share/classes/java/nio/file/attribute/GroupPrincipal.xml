                A {@code UserPrincipal} representing a &lt;em&gt;group identity&lt;/em&gt;, used to
                  determine access rights to objects in a file system. The exact definition of
                  a group is implementation specific, but typically, it represents an identity
                  created for administrative purposes so as to determine the access rights for
                  the members of the group. Whether an entity can be a member of multiple
                  groups, and whether groups can be nested, are implementation specified and
                  therefore not specified.
