                An event or a repeated event for an object that is registered with a {@link WatchService}.
                  &lt;p&gt; An event is classified by its {@link #kind() kind} and has a {@link #count() count} to indicate the number of times that the event has been
                  observed. This allows for efficient representation of repeated events. The{@link #context() context} method returns any context associated with
                  the event. In the case of a repeated event then the context is the same for
                  all events.
                  &lt;p&gt; Watch events are immutable and safe for use by multiple concurrent
                  threads.
