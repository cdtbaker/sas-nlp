                A multiplexor of {@link SelectableChannel} objects.
                  &lt;p&gt; A selector may be created by invoking the {@link #open open} method of
                  this class, which will use the system&apos;s default {@link java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider &lt;/code&gt;selector provider&lt;code&gt;} to
                  create a new selector.  A selector may also be created by invoking the{@link java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider#openSelector openSelector}method of a custom selector provider.  A selector remains open until it is
                  closed via its {@link #close close} method.
                  &lt;a name=&quot;ks&quot;&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt; A selectable channel&apos;s registration with a selector is represented by a{@link SelectionKey} object.  A selector maintains three sets of selection
                  keys:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;key set&lt;/i&gt; contains the keys representing the current
                  channel registrations of this selector.  This set is returned by the{@link #keys() keys} method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;selected-key set&lt;/i&gt; is the set of keys such that each
                  key&apos;s channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations
                  identified in the key&apos;s interest set during a prior selection operation.
                  This set is returned by the {@link #selectedKeys() selectedKeys} method.
                  The selected-key set is always a subset of the key set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;cancelled-key&lt;/i&gt; set is the set of keys that have been
                  cancelled but whose channels have not yet been deregistered.  This set is
                  not directly accessible.  The cancelled-key set is always a subset of the
                  key set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt; All three sets are empty in a newly-created selector.
                  &lt;p&gt; A key is added to a selector&apos;s key set as a side effect of registering a
                  channel via the channel&apos;s {@link SelectableChannel#register(Selector,int)register} method.  Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
                  selection operations.  The key set itself is not directly modifiable.
                  &lt;p&gt; A key is added to its selector&apos;s cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
                  whether by closing its channel or by invoking its {@link SelectionKey#cancelcancel} method.  Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
                  during the next selection operation, at which time the key will removed from
                  all of the selector&apos;s key sets.
                  &lt;a name=&quot;sks&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
                  operations.  A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
                  invoking the set&apos;s {@link java.util.Set#remove(java.lang.Object) remove}method or by invoking the {@link java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method
                  of an {@link java.util.Iterator &lt;/code&gt;iterator&lt;code&gt;} obtained from the
                  set.  Keys are never removed from the selected-key set in any other way;
                  they are not, in particular, removed as a side effect of selection
                  operations.  Keys may not be added directly to the selected-key set. &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;a name=&quot;selop&quot;&gt;
                  &lt;h4&gt;Selection&lt;/h4&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt; During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
                  selector&apos;s selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
                  cancelled-key sets.  Selection is performed by the {@link #select()}, {@link #select(long)}, and {@link #selectNow()} methods, and involves three steps:
                  &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;ol&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
                  which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered.  This step leaves
                  the cancelled-key set empty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
                  readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
                  identified by its key&apos;s interest set as of the moment that the selection
                  operation began.  For a channel that is ready for at least one such
                  operation, one of the following two actions is performed: &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;ol type=a&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the channel&apos;s key is not already in the selected-key set then
                  it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
                  identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
                  to be ready.  Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
                  set is discarded.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise the channel&apos;s key is already in the selected-key set,
                  so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
                  for which the channel is reported to be ready.  Any readiness
                  information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
                  words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
                  bitwise-disjoined into the key&apos;s current ready set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  If all of the keys in the key set at the start of this step have empty
                  interest sets then neither the selected-key set nor any of the keys&apos;
                  ready-operation sets will be updated.
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
                  in progress then they are processed as in step (1). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ol&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt; Whether or not a selection operation blocks to wait for one or more
                  channels to become ready, and if so for how long, is the only essential
                  difference between the three selection methods. &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;h4&gt;Concurrency&lt;/h4&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt; Selectors are themselves safe for use by multiple concurrent threads;
                  their key sets, however, are not.
                  &lt;p&gt; The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the key
                  set, and on the selected-key set, in that order.  They also synchronize on
                  the cancelled-key set during steps (1) and (3) above.
                  &lt;p&gt; Changes made to the interest sets of a selector&apos;s keys while a
                  selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
                  will be seen by the next selection operation.
                  &lt;p&gt; Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time.  Hence the
                  presence of a key in one or more of a selector&apos;s key sets does not imply
                  that the key is valid or that its channel is open.  Application code should
                  be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
                  is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.
                  &lt;p&gt; A thread blocked in one of the {@link #select()} or {@link #select(long)} methods may be interrupted by some other thread in one of
                  three ways:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; By invoking the selector&apos;s {@link #wakeup wakeup} method,
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; By invoking the selector&apos;s {@link #close close} method, or
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; By invoking the blocked thread&apos;s {@link java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupt} method, in which case its
                  interrupt status will be set and the selector&apos;s {@link #wakeup wakeup}method will be invoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt; The {@link #close close} method synchronizes on the selector and all
                  three key sets in the same order as in a selection operation.
                  &lt;a name=&quot;ksc&quot;&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt; A selector&apos;s key and selected-key sets are not, in general, safe for use
                  by multiple concurrent threads.  If such a thread might modify one of these
                  sets directly then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set
                  itself.  The iterators returned by these sets&apos; {@link java.util.Set#iterator() iterator} methods are &lt;i&gt;fail-fast:&lt;/i&gt; If the set
                  is modified after the iterator is created, in any way except by invoking the
                  iterator&apos;s own {@link java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method, then a{@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException} will be thrown. &lt;/p&gt;

                  will return immediately.  If no selection operation is currently in
