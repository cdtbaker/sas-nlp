                A handler for consuming the result of an asynchronous I/O operation.
                  &lt;p&gt; The asynchronous channels defined in this package allow a completion
                  handler to be specified to consume the result of an asynchronous operation.
                  The {@link #completed completed} method is invoked when the I/O operation
                  completes successfully. The {@link #failed failed} method is invoked if the
                  I/O operations fails. The implementations of these methods should complete
                  in a timely manner so as to avoid keeping the invoking thread from dispatching
                  to other completion handlers.
