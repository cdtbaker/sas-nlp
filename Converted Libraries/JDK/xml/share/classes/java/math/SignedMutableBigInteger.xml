                A class used to represent multiprecision integers that makes efficient
                  use of allocated space by allowing a number to occupy only part of
                  an array so that the arrays do not have to be reallocated as often.
                  When performing an operation with many iterations the array used to
                  hold a number is only increased when necessary and does not have to
                  be the same size as the number it represents. A mutable number allows
                  calculations to occur on the same number without having to create
                  a new number for every step of the calculation as occurs with
                  BigIntegers.
                  Note that SignedMutableBigIntegers only support signed addition and
                  subtraction. All other operations occur as with MutableBigIntegers.
