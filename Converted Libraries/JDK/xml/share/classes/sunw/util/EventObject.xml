                FOR BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY ONLY - DO NOT USE.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  This is a backwards compatibility class to allow Java Beans that
                  were developed under JDK 1.0.2 to run correctly under JDK 1.1
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  To allow beans development under JDK 1.0.2, JavaSoft delivered three
                  no-op interfaces/classes (sunw.io.Serializable, sunw.util.EventObject
                  and sunw.util.EventListener) that could be downloaded into JDK 1.0.2
                  systems and which would act as placeholders for the real JDK 1.1
                  classes.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  Now under JDK 1.1 we provide versions of these classes and interfaces
                  that inherit from the real version in java.util and java.io.  These
                  mean that beans developed under JDK 1.0.2 against the sunw. classes
                  will now continue to work on JDK 1.1 and will (indirectly) inherit
                  from the approrpiate java. interfaces/classes.                
                <deprecated>
                    This is a compatibility type to allow Java Beans that
                      were developed under JDK 1.0.2 to run correctly under JDK 1.1.  The
                      corresponding JDK1.1 type is java.util.EventObject
