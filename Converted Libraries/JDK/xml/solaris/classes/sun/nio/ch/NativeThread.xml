                Returns an opaque token representing the native thread underlying the
                 invoking Java thread.  On systems that do not require signalling, this
                 method always returns -1.

                Signals the given native thread so as to release it from a blocking I/O
                 operation.  On systems that do not require signalling, this method has
                 no effect.
