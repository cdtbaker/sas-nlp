                  An interface for performing matrix decompositions on a {@link org.ejml.data.DenseMatrix64F}.
                  &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  A matrix decomposition is an algorithm which decomposes the input matrix into a set of equivalent
                  matrices that store the same information as the original.  Decompositions are useful
                  in that they allow specialized efficient algorithms to be run on generic input
                  matrices.
                  &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  By default most decompositions will modify the input matrix.  This is done to save
                  memory and simply code by reducing the number of cases which need to be tested.
