                  In modern computers there are high speed memory caches.  It is assumed that a square
                  block with this width can be contained entirely in one of those caches.  Settings this
                  value too large can have a dramatic effect on performance in some situations.  Setting
                  it too low results in a less dramatic performance hit.  The optimal value is dependent
                  on the computer&apos;s memory architecture.

                  In benchmarks  the basic actually performed slightly better at 1000
                  but in JVM 1.6 it some times get stuck in a mode where the basic version was very slow
                  in that case the block performed much better.
