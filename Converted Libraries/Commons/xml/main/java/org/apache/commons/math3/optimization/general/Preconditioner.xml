                Precondition a search direction.
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  The returned preconditioned search direction must be computed fast or
                  the algorithm performances will drop drastically. A classical approach
                  is to compute only the diagonal elements of the hessian and to divide
                  the raw search direction by these elements if they are all positive.
                  If at least one of them is negative, it is safer to return a clone of
                  the raw search direction as if the hessian was the identity matrix. The
                  rationale for this simplified choice is that a negative diagonal element
                  means the current point is far from the optimum and preconditioning will
                  not be efficient anyway in this case.
