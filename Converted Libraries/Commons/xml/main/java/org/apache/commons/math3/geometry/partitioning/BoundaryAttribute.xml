                Class holding boundary attributes.
                  &lt;p&gt;This class is used for the attributes associated with the
                  nodes of region boundary shell trees returned by the {@link Region#getTree(boolean) Region.getTree(includeBoundaryAttributes)}when the boolean {@code includeBoundaryAttributes} parameter is
                  set to {@code true}. It contains the parts of the node cut
                  sub-hyperplane that belong to the boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
