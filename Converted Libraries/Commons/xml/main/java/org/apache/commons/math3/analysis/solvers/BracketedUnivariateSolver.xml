                Interface for {@link UnivariateSolver (univariate real) root-finding
                  algorithms} that maintain a bracketed solution. There are several advantages
                  to having such root-finding algorithms:
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;The bracketed solution guarantees that the root is kept within the
                  interval. As such, these algorithms generally also guarantee
                  convergence.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;The bracketed solution means that we have the opportunity to only
                  return roots that are greater than or equal to the actual root, or
                  are less than or equal to the actual root. That is, we can control
                  whether under-approximations and over-approximations are{@link AllowedSolution allowed solutions}. Other root-finding
                  algorithms can usually only guarantee that the solution (the root that
                  was found) is around the actual root.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;For backwards compatibility, all root-finding algorithms must have{@link AllowedSolution#ANY_SIDE ANY_SIDE} as default for the allowed
                  solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
