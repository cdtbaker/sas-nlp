                This interface specifies how to check if an optimization algorithm has
                  converged.
                  &lt;br/&gt;
                  Deciding if convergence has been reached is a problem-dependent issue. The
                  user should provide a class implementing this interface to allow the
                  optimization algorithm to stop its search according to the problem at hand.
                  &lt;br/&gt;
                  For convenience, three implementations that fit simple needs are already
                  provided: {@link SimpleValueChecker}, {@link SimpleVectorValueChecker} and{@link SimplePointChecker}. The first two consider that convergence is
                  reached when the objective function value does not change much anymore, it
                  does not use the point set at all.
                  The third one considers that convergence is reached when the input point
                  set does not change much anymore, it does not use objective function value
                  at all.
