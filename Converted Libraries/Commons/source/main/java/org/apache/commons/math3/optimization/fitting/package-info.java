/** 
 * This package provides classes to perform curve fitting.
 * <p>Curve fitting is a special case of a least squares problem
 * were the parameters are the coefficients of a function <code>f</code>
 * whose graph <code>y=f(x)</code> should pass through sample points, and
 * were the objective function is the squared sum of residuals
 * <code>f(x<sub>i</sub>)-y<sub>i</sub></code> for observed points
 * (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>).</p>
