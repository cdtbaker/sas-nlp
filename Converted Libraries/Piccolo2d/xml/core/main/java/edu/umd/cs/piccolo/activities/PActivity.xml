                &lt;b&gt;PActivity&lt;/b&gt; controls some time dependent aspect of Piccolo, such as
                  animation. Once created activities must be scheduled with the
                  PActivityScheduler managed by the PRoot to run. They are automatically
                  removed from the scheduler when the animation has finished.
                  &lt;P&gt;
                  See the PNode.animate() methods for an example of how to set up and run
                  different activities.
