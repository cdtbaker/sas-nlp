                &lt;b&gt;PBasicInputEventHandler&lt;/b&gt; is the standard class in Piccolo that is used
                  to register for mouse and keyboard events on a PNode. Note the events that
                  you get depends on the node that you have registered with. For example you
                  will only get mouse moved events when the mouse is over the node that you
                  have registered with, not when the mouse is over some other node.
