                &lt;b&gt;PNodeLocator&lt;/b&gt; provides an abstraction for locating points on a node.
                  Points are located in the local corrdinate system of the node. The default
                  behavior is to locate the center point of the nodes bounds. The node where
                  the point is located is stored internal to this locator (as an instance
                  varriable). If you want to use the same locator to locate center points on
                  many different nodes you will need to call setNode() before asking for each
                  location.
