    <text>This interface defines mappers between a space and one of its sub-spaces.
 * &lt;p&gt;Sub-spaces are the lower dimensions subsets of a n-dimensions
 * space. The (n-1)-dimension sub-spaces are specific sub-spaces known
 * as {@link Hyperplane hyperplanes}. This interface can be used regardless
 * of the dimensions differences. As an example, {@link org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.threed.Line Line} in 3D
 * implements Embedding&lt;{@link org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.threed.Vector3D Vector3D}, {link
 * org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.oned.Vector1D Vector1D&gt;, i.e. it
 * maps directly dimensions 3 and 1.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;In the 3D euclidean space, hyperplanes are 2D planes, and the 1D
 * sub-spaces are lines.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
