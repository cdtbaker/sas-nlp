    <text>Generate a random scalar with null mean and unit standard deviation.
 * &lt;p&gt;This method does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; specify the shape of the
 * distribution, it is the implementing class that provides it. The
 * only contract here is to generate numbers with null mean and unit
 * standard deviation.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
