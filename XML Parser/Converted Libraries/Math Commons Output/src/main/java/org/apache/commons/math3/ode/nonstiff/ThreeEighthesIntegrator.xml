  <javadoc>
    <text>This class implements the 3/8 fourth order Runge-Kutta
 * integrator for Ordinary Differential Equations.
 * &lt;p&gt;This method is an explicit Runge-Kutta method, its Butcher-array
 * is the following one :
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * 0  |  0    0    0    0
 * 1/3 | 1/3   0    0    0
 * 2/3 |-1/3   1    0    0
 * 1  |  1   -1    1    0
 * |--------------------
 * | 1/8  3/8  3/8  1/8
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;/p&gt;</text>
