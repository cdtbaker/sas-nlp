    <text>Computes an interpolating function for the data set.</text>
    <param>xval the arguments for the interpolation points.{@code xval[i][0]} is the first component of interpolation point{@code i}, {@code xval[i][1]} is the second component, and so on
 * until {@code xval[i][d-1]}, the last component of that interpolation
 * point (where {@code d} is thus the dimension of the space).</param>
    <param>yval the values for the interpolation points</param>
    <return>a function which interpolates the data set</return>
    <throws>MathIllegalArgumentException if the arguments violate assumptions
 * made by the interpolation algorithm.</throws>
    <throws>DimensionMismatchException when the array dimensions are not consistent.</throws>
    <throws>NoDataException if an array has zero-length.</throws>
    <throws>NullArgumentException if the arguments are {@code null}.</throws>
