  <javadoc>
    <text>This interface represents a first order differential equations set.
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface should be implemented by all real first order
 * differential equation problems before they can be handled by the
 * integrators {@link FirstOrderIntegrator#integrate} method.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;A first order differential equations problem, as seen by an
 * integrator is the time derivative &lt;code&gt;dY/dt&lt;/code&gt; of a state
 * vector &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;, both being one dimensional arrays. From the
 * integrator point of view, this derivative depends only on the
 * current time &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; and on the state vector
 * &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;For real problems, the derivative depends also on parameters
 * that do not belong to the state vector (dynamical model constants
 * for example). These constants are completely outside of the scope
 * of this interface, the classes that implement it are allowed to
 * handle them as they want.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
