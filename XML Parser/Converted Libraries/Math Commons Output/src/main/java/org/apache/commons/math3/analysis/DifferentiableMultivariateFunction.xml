  <method name="partialDerivative" type="MultivariateFunction" />
  <javadoc>
    <text>Returns the partial derivative of the function with respect to a point coordinate.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The partial derivative is defined with respect to point coordinate
 * x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. If the partial derivatives with respect to all coordinates are
 * needed, it may be more efficient to use the {@link #gradient()} method which will
 * compute them all at once.
 * &lt;/p&gt;</text>
    <param>k index of the coordinate with respect to which the partial
 * derivative is computed</param>
    <return>the partial derivative function with respect to k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; point coordinate</return>
  </javadoc>
  <method name="gradient" type="MultivariateVectorFunction" />
  <javadoc>
    <text>Returns the gradient function.
 * &lt;p&gt;If only one partial derivative with respect to a specific coordinate is
 * needed, it may be more efficient to use the {@link #partialDerivative(int)} method
 * which will compute only the specified component.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
