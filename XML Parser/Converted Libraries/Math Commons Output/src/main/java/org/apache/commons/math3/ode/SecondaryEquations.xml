  <javadoc>
    <text>This interface allows users to add secondary differential equations to a primary
 * set of differential equations.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In some cases users may need to integrate some problem-specific equations along
 * with a primary set of differential equations. One example is optimal control where
 * adjoined parameters linked to the minimized hamiltonian must be integrated.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This interface allows users to add such equations to a primary set of {@link FirstOrderDifferentialEquations first order differential equations}thanks to the {@link ExpandableStatefulODE#addSecondaryEquations(SecondaryEquations)}method.
 * &lt;/p&gt;</text>
