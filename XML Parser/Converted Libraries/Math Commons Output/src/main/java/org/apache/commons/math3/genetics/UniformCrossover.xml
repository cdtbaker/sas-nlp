<class name="UniformCrossover">
  <javadoc>
    <text>Perform Uniform Crossover [UX] on the specified chromosomes. A fixed mixing
 * ratio is used to combine genes from the first and second parents, e.g. using a
 * ratio of 0.5 would result in approximately 50% of genes coming from each
 * parent. This is typically a poor method of crossover, but empirical evidence
 * suggests that it is more exploratory and results in a larger part of the
 * problem space being searched.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This crossover policy evaluates each gene of the parent chromosomes by chosing a
 * uniform random number {@code p} in the range [0, 1]. If {@code p} &amp;lt; {@code ratio},
 * the parent genes are swapped. This means with a ratio of 0.7, 30% of the genes from the
 * first parent and 70% from the second parent will be selected for the first offspring (and
 * vice versa for the second offspring).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This policy works only on {@link AbstractListChromosome}, and therefore it
 * is parameterized by T. Moreover, the chromosomes must have same lengths.</text>
