    <text>Special implementation of the {@link MultivariateOptimizer} interface adding
 * multi-start features to an existing optimizer.
 * This class wraps a classical optimizer to use it several times in
 * turn with different starting points in order to avoid being trapped
 * into a local extremum when looking for a global one.</text>
