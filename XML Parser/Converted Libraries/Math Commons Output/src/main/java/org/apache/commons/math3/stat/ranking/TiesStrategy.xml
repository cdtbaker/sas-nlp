    <text>Strategies for handling tied values in rank transformations.
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;SEQUENTIAL - Ties are assigned ranks in order of occurrence in the original array,
 * for example (1,3,4,3) is ranked as (1,2,4,3)&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;MINIMUM - Tied values are assigned the minimum applicable rank, or the rank
 * of the first occurrence. For example, (1,3,4,3) is ranked as (1,2,4,2)&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;MAXIMUM - Tied values are assigned the maximum applicable rank, or the rank
 * of the last occurrence. For example, (1,3,4,3) is ranked as (1,3,4,3)&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;AVERAGE - Tied values are assigned the average of the applicable ranks.
 * For example, (1,3,4,3) is ranked as (1,2.5,4,2.5)&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;RANDOM - Tied values are assigned a random integer rank from among the
 * applicable values. The assigned rank will always be an integer, (inclusively)
 * between the values returned by the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;</text>
