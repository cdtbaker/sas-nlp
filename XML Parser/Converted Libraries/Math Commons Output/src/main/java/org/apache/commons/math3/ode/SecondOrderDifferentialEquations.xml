    <text>This interface represents a second order differential equations set.
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface should be implemented by all real second order
 * differential equation problems before they can be handled by the
 * integrators {@link SecondOrderIntegrator#integrate} method.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;A second order differential equations problem, as seen by an
 * integrator is the second time derivative &lt;code&gt;d2Y/dt^2&lt;/code&gt; of a
 * state vector &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;, both being one dimensional
 * arrays. From the integrator point of view, this derivative depends
 * only on the current time &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, on the state vector
 * &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; and on the first time derivative of the state
 * vector.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;For real problems, the derivative depends also on parameters
 * that do not belong to the state vector (dynamical model constants
 * for example). These constants are completely outside of the scope
 * of this interface, the classes that implement it are allowed to
 * handle them as they want.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
