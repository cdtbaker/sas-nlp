    <text>Strategies for handling NaN values in rank transformations.
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;MINIMAL - NaNs are treated as minimal in the ordering, equivalent to
 * (that is, tied with) &lt;code&gt;Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;MAXIMAL - NaNs are treated as maximal in the ordering, equivalent to
 * &lt;code&gt;Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;REMOVED - NaNs are removed before the rank transform is applied&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;FIXED - NaNs are left "in place," that is the rank transformation is
 * applied to the other elements in the input array, but the NaN elements
 * are returned unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;FAILED - If any NaN is encountered in the input array, an appropriate
 * exception is thrown&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;</text>
