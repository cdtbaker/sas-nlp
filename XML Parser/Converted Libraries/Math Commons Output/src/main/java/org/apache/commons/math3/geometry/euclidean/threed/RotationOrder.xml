  <javadoc>
    <text>This class is a utility representing a rotation order specification
 * for Cardan or Euler angles specification.
 * This class cannot be instanciated by the user. He can only use one
 * of the twelve predefined supported orders as an argument to either
 * the {@link Rotation#Rotation(RotationOrder,double,double,double)}constructor or the {@link Rotation#getAngles} method.</text>
