    <text>Test case for {@link MullerSolver2 Muller} solver.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Muller's method converges almost quadratically near roots, but it can
 * be very slow in regions far away from zeros. Test runs show that for
 * reasonably good initial values, for a default absolute accuracy of 1E-6,
 * it generally takes 5 to 10 iterations for the solver to converge.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Tests for the exponential function illustrate the situations where
 * Muller solver performs poorly.</text>
