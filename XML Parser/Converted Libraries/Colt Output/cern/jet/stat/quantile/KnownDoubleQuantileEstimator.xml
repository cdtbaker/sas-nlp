    <text>Approximate quantile finding algorithm for known &lt;tt&gt;N&lt;/tt&gt; requiring only one pass and little main memory; computes quantiles over a sequence of &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; elements.
 * &lt;p&gt;Needs as input the following parameters:&lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;dt&gt;1. &lt;tt&gt;N&lt;/tt&gt; - the number of values of the data sequence over which quantiles are to be determined.
 * &lt;dt&gt;2. &lt;tt&gt;quantiles&lt;/tt&gt; - the number of quantiles to be computed.
 * &lt;dt&gt;3. &lt;tt&gt;epsilon&lt;/tt&gt; - the allowed approximation error on quantiles. The approximation guarantee of this algorithm is explicit.
 * &lt;p&gt;It is also possible to couple the approximation algorithm with random sampling to further reduce memory requirements. 
 * With sampling, the approximation guarantees are explicit but probabilistic, i.e. they apply with respect to a (user controlled) confidence parameter "delta".
 * &lt;dt&gt;4. &lt;tt&gt;delta&lt;/tt&gt; - the probability allowed that the approximation error fails to be smaller than epsilon. Set &lt;tt&gt;delta&lt;/tt&gt; to zero for explicit non probabilistic guarantees.
 * You usually don't instantiate quantile finders by using the constructor. Instead use the factory &lt;tt&gt;QuantileFinderFactor&lt;/tt&gt; to do so. It will set up the right parametrization for you.

    <comment>The KNOWN quantile finder reads off quantiles from FULL buffers only.
 Since there might be a partially full buffer, this method first satisfies this constraint by temporarily filling a few +infinity, -infinity elements to make up a full block.
 This is in full conformance with the explicit approximation guarantees.

 For those of you working on online apps:
 The approximation guarantees are given for computing quantiles AFTER N elements have been filled, not for intermediate displays.
 If you have one thread filling and another thread displaying concurrently, you will note that in the very beginning the infinities will dominate the display.
 This could confuse users, because, of course, they don't expect any infinities, even if they "disappear" after a short while.
 To prevent panic exclude phi's close to zero or one in the early phases of processing.</comment>

    <comment>This is a KNOWN N quantile finder!
 One should not try to fill more than N elements,
 because otherwise we can't give explicit approximation guarantees anymore.
 Use an UNKNOWN quantile finder instead if your app may fill more than N elements.

 However, to make this class meaningful even under wired use cases, we actually do allow to fill more than N elements (without explicit approx. guarantees, of course).
 Normally, elements beyond N will not get sampled because the sampler is exhausted.
 Therefore the histogram will no more change no matter how much you fill.
 This might not be what the user expects.
 Therefore we use a new (unexhausted) sampler with the same parametrization.

 If you want this class to ignore any elements beyong N, then comment the following line.</comment>
    <comment>if ((totalElementsFilled-1) % N == 0) setSamplingRate(samplingRate, N);  delete if appropriate</comment>
