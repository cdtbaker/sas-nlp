  <javadoc>
    <text>This empty class is the common root for all persistent capable classes.
 * If this class inherits from &lt;tt&gt;java.lang.Object&lt;/tt&gt; then all subclasses are serializable with the standard Java serialization mechanism.
 * If this class inherits from &lt;tt&gt;com.objy.db.app.ooObj&lt;/tt&gt; then all subclasses are &lt;i&gt;additionally&lt;/i&gt; serializable with the Objectivity ODBMS persistance mechanism.
 * Thus, by modifying the inheritance of this class the entire tree of subclasses can be switched to Objectivity compatibility (and back) with minimum effort.</text>
