            The kinds of solutions that a {@link BracketedUnivariateSolver(bracketed univariate real) root-finding algorithm} may accept as solutions.
              This basically controls whether or not under-approximations and
              over-approximations are allowed.
              &lt;p&gt;If all solutions are accepted ({@link #ANY_SIDE}), then the solution
              that the root-finding algorithm returns for a given root may be equal to the
              actual root, but it may also be an approximation that is slightly smaller
              or slightly larger than the actual root. Root-finding algorithms generally
              only guarantee that the returned solution is within the requested
              tolerances. In certain cases however, in particular for{@link org.apache.commons.math3.ode.events.EventHandler state events} of{@link org.apache.commons.math3.ode.ODEIntegrator ODE solvers}, it
              may be necessary to guarantee that a solution is returned that lies on a
              specific side the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

            There are no additional side restriction on the solutions for
              root-finding. That is, both under-approximations and over-approximations
              are allowed. So, if a function f(x) has a root at x = x0, then the
              root-finding result s may be smaller than x0, equal to x0, or greater
              than x0.
