                Interface handling decomposition algorithms that can solve A &amp;times; X = B.
                  &lt;p&gt;Decomposition algorithms decompose an A matrix has a product of several specific
                  matrices from which they can solve A &amp;times; X = B in least squares sense: they find X
                  such that ||A &amp;times; X - B|| is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Some solvers like {@link LUDecomposition} can only find the solution for
                  square matrices and when the solution is an exact linear solution, i.e. when
                  ||A &amp;times; X - B|| is exactly 0. Other solvers can also find solutions
                  with non-square matrix A and with non-null minimal norm. If an exact linear
                  solution exists it is also the minimal norm solution.&lt;/p&gt;
