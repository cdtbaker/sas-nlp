                This interface specifies how to check if an optimization algorithm has
                 * converged.
                 * &lt;br/&gt;
                 * Deciding if convergence has been reached is a problem-dependent issue. The
                 * user should provide a class implementing this interface to allow the
                 * optimization algorithm to stop its search according to the problem at hand.
                 * &lt;br/&gt;
                 * For convenience, three implementations that fit simple needs are already
                 * provided: {@link SimpleValueChecker}, {@link SimpleVectorValueChecker} and{@link SimplePointChecker}. The first two consider that convergence is
                 * reached when the objective function value does not change much anymore, it
                 * does not use the point set at all.
                 * The third one considers that convergence is reached when the input point
                 * set does not change much anymore, it does not use objective function value
                 * at all.
