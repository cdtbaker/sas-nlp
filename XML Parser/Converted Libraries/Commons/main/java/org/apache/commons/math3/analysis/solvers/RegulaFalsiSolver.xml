    <javadoc>
      <text>* Implements the <em>Regula Falsi</em> or <em>False position</em> method for
 * root-finding (approximating a zero of a univariate real function). It is a
 * modified {@link SecantSolver <em>Secant</em>} method.
 * <p>The <em>Regula Falsi</em> method is included for completeness, for
 * testing purposes, for educational purposes, for comparison to other
 * algorithms, etc. It is however <strong>not</strong> intended to be used
 * for actual problems, as one of the bounds often remains fixed, resulting
 * in very slow convergence. Instead, one of the well-known modified
 * <em>Regula Falsi</em> algorithms can be used ({@link IllinoisSolver<em>Illinois</em>} or {@link PegasusSolver <em>Pegasus</em>}). These two
 * algorithms solve the fundamental issues of the original <em>Regula
 * Falsi</em> algorithm, and greatly out-performs it for most, if not all,
 * (practical) functions.
 * <p>Unlike the <em>Secant</em> method, the <em>Regula Falsi</em> guarantees
 * convergence, by maintaining a bracketed solution. Note however, that due to
 * the finite/limited precision of Java's {@link Double double} type, which is
 * used in this implementation, the algorithm may get stuck in a situation
 * where it no longer makes any progress. Such cases are detected and result
 * in a {@code ConvergenceException} exception being thrown. In other words,
 * the algorithm theoretically guarantees convergence, but the implementation
 * does not.</p>
 * <p>The <em>Regula Falsi</em> method assumes that the function is continuous,
 * but not necessarily smooth.</p>
 * <p>Implementation based on the following article: M. Dowell and P. Jarratt,
 * <em>A modified regula falsi method for computing the root of an
 * equation</em>, BIT Numerical Mathematics, volume 11, number 2,
 * pages 168-174, Springer, 1971.</p></text>
