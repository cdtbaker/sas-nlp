    <text>* The kinds of solutions that a {@link BracketedUnivariateSolver(bracketed univariate real) root-finding algorithm} may accept as solutions.
 * This basically controls whether or not under-approximations and
 * over-approximations are allowed.
 * <p>If all solutions are accepted ({@link #ANY_SIDE}), then the solution
 * that the root-finding algorithm returns for a given root may be equal to the
 * actual root, but it may also be an approximation that is slightly smaller
 * or slightly larger than the actual root. Root-finding algorithms generally
 * only guarantee that the returned solution is within the requested
 * tolerances. In certain cases however, in particular for{@link org.apache.commons.math3.ode.events.EventHandler state events} of{@link org.apache.commons.math3.ode.ODEIntegrator ODE solvers}, it
 * may be necessary to guarantee that a solution is returned that lies on a
 * specific side the solution.</p></text>

    <text>* There are no additional side restriction on the solutions for
 * root-finding. That is, both under-approximations and over-approximations
 * are allowed. So, if a function f(x) has a root at x = x0, then the
 * root-finding result s may be smaller than x0, equal to x0, or greater
 * than x0.</text>

  <javadoc>
    <text>* Only solutions that are less than or equal to the actual root are
 * acceptable as solutions for root-finding. In other words,
 * over-approximations are not allowed. So, if a function f(x) has a root
 * at x = x0, then the root-finding result s must satisfy s &lt;= x0.</text>
