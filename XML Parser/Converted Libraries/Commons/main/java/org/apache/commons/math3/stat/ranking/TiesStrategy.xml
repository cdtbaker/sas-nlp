    <text>* Strategies for handling tied values in rank transformations.
 * <ul>
 * <li>SEQUENTIAL - Ties are assigned ranks in order of occurrence in the original array,
 * for example (1,3,4,3) is ranked as (1,2,4,3)</li>
 * <li>MINIMUM - Tied values are assigned the minimum applicable rank, or the rank
 * of the first occurrence. For example, (1,3,4,3) is ranked as (1,2,4,2)</li>
 * <li>MAXIMUM - Tied values are assigned the maximum applicable rank, or the rank
 * of the last occurrence. For example, (1,3,4,3) is ranked as (1,3,4,3)</li>
 * <li>AVERAGE - Tied values are assigned the average of the applicable ranks.
 * For example, (1,3,4,3) is ranked as (1,2.5,4,2.5)</li>
 * <li>RANDOM - Tied values are assigned a random integer rank from among the
 * applicable values. The assigned rank will always be an integer, (inclusively)
 * between the values returned by the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM strategies.</li>
