      <text>* Interface handling decomposition algorithms that can solve A &times; X = B.
 * <p>Decomposition algorithms decompose an A matrix has a product of several specific
 * matrices from which they can solve A &times; X = B in least squares sense: they find X
 * such that ||A &times; X - B|| is minimal.</p>
 * <p>Some solvers like {@link FieldLUDecomposition} can only find the solution for
 * square matrices and when the solution is an exact linear solution, i.e. when
 * ||A &times; X - B|| is exactly 0. Other solvers can also find solutions
 * with non-square matrix A and with non-null minimal norm. If an exact linear
 * solution exists it is also the minimal norm solution.</p></text>
