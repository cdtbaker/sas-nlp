 * An augmented system matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form (RREF) if the following are true:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>If a row has non-zero entries, then the first non-zero entry is 1.  This is known as the leading one.</li>
 * <li>If a column contains a leading one then all other entries in that column are zero.</li>
 * <li>If a row contains a leading 1, then each row above contains a leading 1 further to the left.</li>
 * </ol>
