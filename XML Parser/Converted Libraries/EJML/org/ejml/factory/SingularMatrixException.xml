    <javadoc>
      <text>* This exception is thrown if an operation can not be finished because the matrix is singular.
 * It is a RuntimeException to allow the code to be written cleaner and also because singular
 * matrices are not always detected.  Forcing an exception to be caught provides a false sense
 * of security.</text>
