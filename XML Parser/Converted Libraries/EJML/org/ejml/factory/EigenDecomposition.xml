      <text>* <p>
 * This is a generic interface for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
 * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have the following property:<br>
 * <br>
 * A*v=&lambda;*v<br>
 * <br>
 * where A is a square matrix and v is an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue &lambda;.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In general, both eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be complex numbers.  For symmetric matrices the
 * eigenvalues and eigenvectors are always real numbers.  EJML does not support complex matrices but
 * it does have minimal support for complex numbers.  As a result complex eigenvalues are found, but only
 * the real eigenvectors are computed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To create a new instance of {@link EigenDecomposition} use {@link DecompositionFactory}. If the matrix
 * is known to be symmetric be sure to use the symmetric decomposition, which is much faster and more accurate
 * than the general purpose one.

 * Returns an eigenvalue as a complex number.  For symmetric matrices the returned eigenvalue will always be a real
 * number, which means the imaginary component will be equal to zero.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The order of the eigenvalues is dependent upon the decomposition algorithm used.  This means that they may
 * or may not be ordered by magnitude.  For example the QR algorithm will returns results that are partially
 * ordered by magnitude, but this behavior should not be relied upon.
