      <text>* To avoid cpu cache issues the order in which the arrays are traversed have been changed.
 * There seems to be no performance benit relative to {@link LinearSolverLu} in this approach
 * and b and x can't be the same instance, which means it has slightly less functionality.</text>

      <text>* An other implementation of solve() that processes the matrices in a different order.
 * It seems to have the same runtime performance as {@link #solve} and is more complicated.
 * It is being kept around to avoid future replication of work.</text>
