<class name="EigenDecomposition">
  <javadoc>
    <text>&lt;p&gt;
 * This is a generic interface for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
 * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have the following property:&lt;br&gt;
 * &lt;br&gt;
 * A*v=&amp;lambda;*v&lt;br&gt;
 * &lt;br&gt;
 * where A is a square matrix and v is an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue &amp;lambda;.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In general, both eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be complex numbers.  For symmetric matrices the
 * eigenvalues and eigenvectors are always real numbers.  EJML does not support complex matrices but
 * it does have minimal support for complex numbers.  As a result complex eigenvalues are found, but only
 * the real eigenvectors are computed.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To create a new instance of {@link EigenDecomposition} use {@link DecompositionFactory}. If the matrix
 * is known to be symmetric be sure to use the symmetric decomposition, which is much faster and more accurate
 * than the general purpose one.

  <method name="getNumberOfEigenvalues" type="int" />
  <javadoc>
    <text>Returns the number of eigenvalues/eigenvectors.  This is the matrix's dimension.</text>
    <return>number of eigenvalues/eigenvectors.</return>
  </javadoc>
  <method name="getEigenvalue" type="Complex64F" />
  <javadoc>
    <text>&lt;p&gt;
 * Returns an eigenvalue as a complex number.  For symmetric matrices the returned eigenvalue will always be a real
 * number, which means the imaginary component will be equal to zero.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * NOTE: The order of the eigenvalues is dependent upon the decomposition algorithm used.  This means that they may
 * or may not be ordered by magnitude.  For example the QR algorithm will returns results that are partially
 * ordered by magnitude, but this behavior should not be relied upon.

    <return>An eigenvalue.</return>

  <method name="getEigenVector" type="MatrixType" />
  <javadoc>
    <text>&lt;p&gt;
 * Used to retrieve real valued eigenvectors.  If an eigenvector is associated with a complex eigenvalue
 * then null is returned instead.
 * &lt;/p&gt;</text>
    <param>index Index of the eigenvalue eigenvector pair.</param>
    <return>If the associated eigenvalue is real then an eigenvector is returned, null otherwise.</return>
