  <javadoc>
    <text>&lt;p&gt;
 * An interface for performing matrix decompositions on a {@link org.ejml.data.DenseMatrix64F}.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A matrix decomposition is an algorithm which decomposes the input matrix into a set of equivalent
 * matrices that store the same information as the original.  Decompositions are useful
 * in that they allow specialized efficient algorithms to be run on generic input
 * matrices.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * By default most decompositions will modify the input matrix.  This is done to save
 * memory and simply code by reducing the number of cases which need to be tested.
 * &lt;/p&gt;</text>

  <method name="decompose" type="boolean" />
  <javadoc>
    <text>Computes the decomposition of the input matrix.  Depending on the implementation
 * the input matrix might be stored internally or modified.  If it is modified then
 * the function {@link #inputModified()} will return true and the matrix should not be
 * modified until the decomposition is no longer needed.</text>
    <param>orig The matrix which is being decomposed.  Modification is implementation dependent.</param>
    <return>Returns if it was able to decompose the matrix.</return>
  </javadoc>
  <method name="inputModified" type="boolean" />
  <javadoc>
    <text>Is the input matrix to {@link #decompose(org.ejml.data.Matrix64F)} is modified during
 * the decomposition process.</text>
    <return>true if the input matrix to decompose() is modified.</return>
