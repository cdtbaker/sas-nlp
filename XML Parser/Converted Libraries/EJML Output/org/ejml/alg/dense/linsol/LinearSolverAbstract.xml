  <javadoc>
    <text>&lt;p&gt;
 * An abstract class that provides some common functionality and a default implementation
 * of invert that uses the solve function of the child class.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The extending class must explicity call {@link #_setA(org.ejml.data.DenseMatrix64F)}inside of its {@link #setA} function.
 * &lt;/p&gt;</text>
