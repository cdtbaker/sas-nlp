  <javadoc>
    <text>Wrapper that allows {@link org.ejml.factory.LinearSolver &lt;BlockMatrix64F&gt;} to implements {@link org.ejml.factory.LinearSolver}.  It works
 * by converting {@link DenseMatrix64F} into {@link BlockMatrix64F} and calling the equivalent
 * functions.  Since a local copy is made all input matrices are never modified.</text>
