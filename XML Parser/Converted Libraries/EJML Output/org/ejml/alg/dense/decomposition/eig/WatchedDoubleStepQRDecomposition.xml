<class name="WatchedDoubleStepQRDecomposition">
  <javadoc>
    <text>&lt;p&gt;
 * Finds the eigenvalue decomposition of an arbitrary square matrix using the implicit double-step QR algorithm.
 * Watched is included in its name because it is designed to print out internal debugging information.  This
 * class is still underdevelopment and has yet to be optimized.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Based off the description found in:&lt;br&gt;
 * David S. Watkins, "Fundamentals of Matrix Computations." Second Edition.
 * &lt;/p&gt;</text>

  <comment>TODO looks like there might be some pointless copying of arrays going on</comment>
  <comment>should it compute eigenvectors or just eigenvalues</comment>
