<class name="BidiagonalDecomposition">
  <javadoc>
    <text>&lt;p&gt;
 * Computes a matrix decomposition such that:&lt;br&gt;
 * &lt;br&gt;
 * A = U*B*V&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 * &lt;br&gt;
 * where A is m by n, U is orthogonal and m by m, B is an m by n bidiagonal matrix, V is orthogonal and n by n.
 * This is used as a first step in computing the SVD of a matrix for the QR algorithm approach.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A bidiagonal matrix has zeros in every element except for the two diagonals.&lt;br&gt;
 * &lt;br&gt;
 * b_ij = 0    if i &gt; j or i &lt; j-1&lt;br&gt;
 * &lt;/p&gt;</text>
