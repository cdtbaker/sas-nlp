    <text>&lt;p&gt;
 * This implementation of a Cholesky decomposition using the inner-product form.
 * For large matrices a block implementation is better.  On larger matrices the lower triangular
 * decomposition is significantly faster.  This is faster on smaller matrices than {@link CholeskyDecompositionBlock}but much slower on larger matrices.
 * &lt;/p&gt;</text>
