                &lt;b&gt;PNodeLocator&lt;/b&gt; provides an abstraction for locating points on a node.
                 * Points are located in the local corrdinate system of the node. The default
                 * behavior is to locate the center point of the nodes bounds. The node where
                 * the point is located is stored internal to this locator (as an instance
                 * varriable). If you want to use the same locator to locate center points on
                 * many different nodes you will need to call setNode() before asking for each
                 * location.
                 * &lt;P&gt;
